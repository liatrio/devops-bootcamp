# Deliverable

Once you have completed the application, you will be expected to not only demonstrate what you have done, but also what you learned while doing it. Do not simply talk about the end result, talk about the places you got stuck and how you got past those roadblocks. It can be very beneficial to include links to useful material that you used to learn about the subject matter. It is essential that you take time to prepare yourself before this presentation to ensure that you have a clear idea of what you want to say and what you want to demonstrate. As with any sort of public speaking, remaining relaxed and confident is very important, and remember to have fun with this. The audience is not judging you, they are just curious in what you've been working on.
