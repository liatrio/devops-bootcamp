# Exercise 1 - Getting Started

At this point you should have a general idea of how to define the desired state of resources in Terraform. Now you can try these hands on exercises to test it out.

The Hashicorp developers platform has some excellent tutorials to help you get started. Run through either the [AWS](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started) or [Azure](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/azure-get-started) Terraform getting started tutorial.

?> Coordinate with your team to have some people go through the AWS tutorial and some the Azure tutorial and compare you experiences once you are finished.

?> When you create the folder for your Terraform configuration add your name to the folder to make it easier to share `learn-terraform-[aws|azure]-[your_name_here]`.

?> When you get to the *Store Remote State* tutorial have one person create a Terraform Cloud organization and invite the rest of the group to that org so you can share your workspaces.
