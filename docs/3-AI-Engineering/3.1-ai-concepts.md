# AI Concepts

It's important to understand that AI tools are not capable of thinking, and are only trying to imitate what they have seen from their training data. You should never trust anything an AI gives you without verifying it somehow first.

## Overview

The world of AI is rapidly changing, and it can be difficult to grasp all the moving pieces. This section explores a variety of concepts in AI, going beyond just AI agents to include how these systems are built, how they interact with the world and with us, and how they are changing the way we work.

## Key Concepts

### Generative AI

This is a type of AI that can create new content, such as text, images, or code, based on the patterns it has learned from vast amounts of data. Think of it as AI that can not just understand information, but also generate something new based on that information. **Large Language Models (LLMs)** are a key component of generative AI. These models are trained on massive datasets, allowing them to perform tasks like language generation, translation, and even coding.

### AI Agents

These are AI systems that can not only understand instructions but can also use tools to complete tasks autonomously. They use **LLMs** to reason, plan, and make decisions, and they use tools such as databases, APIs, or search engines, to interact with the world. They can be used to automate complex tasks that would be difficult or impossible for an LLM alone.

### Tools

These are the keys that allow AI agents to interact with the outside world and access knowledge beyond their training data. They come in a variety of forms:

- **Extensions:** Bridges between the agent and external APIs, enabling actions like sending emails or fetching data
- **Functions:** Give developers more control over how the agent operates
- **Data Stores:** Provide agents with access to structured or unstructured data

### Cognitive Architectures

These architectures structure how agents reason, plan, and make decisions. They maintain memory and state, which enables agents to respond to user queries, make informed decisions and complete complex tasks. The orchestration layer is responsible for maintaining memory, state, and reasoning.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

This is a technique that enhances the performance of AI models by giving them access to external data sources. RAG systems retrieve relevant information from external knowledge sources and provide it to the LLM to generate a more informed and up-to-date response. This allows the models to extend their knowledge beyond their training data and reduces the problem of AI models "hallucinating," or making up information.

### Multimodal AI

This refers to AI systems that can process information from a variety of sources, including text, images, audio, and video. This enables them to understand and interact with the world in a more human-like way, and is key to developing more sophisticated applications.

### Prompt Engineering

This is the practice of carefully crafting prompts to get the desired output from an AI model. It involves understanding how AI models interpret language and using that understanding to improve the quality and relevance of the responses.

## Why Understanding This Matters

This collection of concepts paints a picture of the evolving landscape of AI. Understanding these concepts can help you:

- Appreciate the capabilities and limitations of AI systems
- Identify new opportunities for AI in your own work and life
- Make informed decisions about adopting and using AI tools
- Contribute to the development of responsible and effective AI solutions

# Deliverables

- How might AI concepts like generative AI, agents, and RAG change the way developers work in the future?
