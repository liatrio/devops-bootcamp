# AI Engineering Best Practices

As AI becomes increasingly integrated into the software development process, it's essential for engineers to develop strong practices for leveraging these tools effectively. This section covers advanced techniques and best practices for working with AI in a professional engineering context.

## Overview

This section explores:

* Advanced techniques for using AI tools in software development
* Structured workflows for AI-assisted development
* Strategies for maintaining engineering rigor when working with AI
* Practical applications of AI in real-world development scenarios

## Subsections

### [3.3.1 Advanced AI Techniques](3.3.1-agentic-best-practices.md)

Learn senior engineering techniques for leveraging AI in your development workflow, including structured approaches to using LLMs while maintaining engineering oversight.

### [3.3.2 Agentic IDEs](3.3.2-agentic-ide.md)

Explore how agentic IDEs represent the next evolution of development environments, integrating AI capabilities directly into the coding workflow.

## Why Best Practices Matter

The integration of AI into software development represents a significant shift in how we approach coding tasks. While these tools offer tremendous potential to enhance productivity and code quality, they also introduce new challenges:

* Ensuring consistent quality when using probabilistic tools
* Maintaining appropriate human oversight and decision-making
* Integrating AI-generated code with existing codebases
* Establishing team-wide protocols for effective AI usage

By developing strong best practices, engineers can harness the power of AI while mitigating potential risks and ensuring that these tools truly enhance rather than undermine engineering excellence.
