# MCP: Model Context Protocol

MCP stands for Model Context Protocol - an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs). Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications: just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

## What is the Model Context Protocol?

The Model Context Protocol is a client-server architecture that enables AI applications to access and utilize various data sources and tools through a standardized interface. It allows LLMs to interact with your local files, databases, APIs, and other resources in a secure and consistent manner.

### Core Components

* **MCP Hosts**: Programs like Claude Desktop, IDEs, or AI tools that want to access data through MCP
* **MCP Clients**: Protocol clients that maintain 1:1 connections with servers
* **MCP Servers**: Lightweight programs that each expose specific capabilities through the standardized Model Context Protocol
* **Local Data Sources**: Your computer's files, databases, and services that MCP servers can securely access
* **Remote Services**: External systems available over the internet (e.g., through APIs) that MCP servers can connect to

## Key Features of MCP

### Resources

Resources in MCP provide a way for AI models to access various types of data, such as:

* Files on your local system
* Content from databases
* Information from web APIs
* Code repositories

Resources are identified by URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) and can be discovered and accessed by the AI model as needed.

### Tools

Tools allow AI models to perform actions beyond just accessing data. MCP tools can:

* Execute code
* Call APIs
* Perform system operations
* Process data
* Interact with external services

Tools are defined with clear input/output specifications and can be discovered dynamically by the AI application.

### Prompts

Prompts in MCP provide structured templates for AI interactions. They help:

* Standardize common interaction patterns
* Ensure consistent AI responses
* Embed contextual information
* Support multi-step workflows

### Roots

Roots provide entry points into your data, helping AI models understand where to start exploring. They can represent:

* Project directories
* Document collections
* Knowledge bases
* Application contexts

## Benefits of MCP

1. **Interoperability**: Connect any MCP-compatible AI model to any MCP-compatible data source or tool
2. **Security**: Keep your data within your infrastructure and control what the AI model can access
3. **Flexibility**: Switch between different AI providers without changing your data integrations
4. **Extensibility**: Create custom MCP servers for specialized data sources or tools
5. **Standardization**: Follow best practices for AI-data interactions

## MCP Implementation

### Client-Side Implementation

* Integrating MCP clients into AI applications
* Discovering and connecting to MCP servers
* Handling resource and tool requests
* Managing authentication and security

### Server-Side Implementation

* Creating custom MCP servers
* Exposing resources and tools
* Implementing security controls
* Optimizing performance

## MCP in Practice

### Common Use Cases

* **Development Environments**: Enabling AI coding assistants to access project files and run code
* **Data Analysis**: Allowing AI models to query databases and analyze results
* **Document Processing**: Letting AI models access and process document collections
* **System Automation**: Using AI to automate tasks across different systems

### Example Applications

* Claude Desktop with filesystem access
* GitHub Copilot with project context
* Windsurf Cascade with tool execution
* AI-powered data analysis tools

## Getting Started with MCP

1. **Choose MCP-compatible AI applications**: Look for applications that support the Model Context Protocol
2. **Install MCP servers**: Set up servers for the data sources and tools you want to use
3. **Configure connections**: Connect your AI application to your MCP servers
4. **Start interacting**: Use your AI application with enhanced context and capabilities

# Exercise: Create an MCP Client

In this exercise, you will create a simple MCP client that can connect to a local MCP server. This will help you understand how MCP enables AI applications to interact with external tools and data sources.

## Instructions

1. Follow the MCP Client Quickstart tutorial at [https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/client](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/client) to create a Python-based MCP client.

2. The tutorial will guide you through:
   * Setting up your development environment
   * Creating a basic MCP client that can connect to servers
   * Implementing a query processing system that handles tool calls
   * Building an interactive chat interface

3. Once you have your client working, connect it to one of the sample MCP servers (like Claude Desktop, Windsurf, or VSCode) to test its functionality.

4. Experiment with modifying the client to handle different types of tools or customize how responses are processed.

## Key Learning Points

* How MCP standardizes interactions between AI applications and external tools/data
* The client-server architecture that enables AI models to access resources beyond their context window
* How tool calls are processed and their results are incorporated into AI responses
* Practical implementation of an MCP client using Python

## Deliverables

* Create a working MCP client based on the tutorial that can connect to at least one MCP server
* Write a brief explanation of how the MCP client-server architecture enhances AI capabilities
* Provide one example of how you might extend or customize your MCP client for a specific use case
* How might the Model Context Protocol change the way developers interact with AI tools in their workflow?
* What are the key benefits of standardizing AI model interactions through MCP?
* How could MCP impact the development of future AI applications?
* Will it be common that organizations want to create their own MCP server?

In the next section, we'll explore how agentic IDEs are transforming the way we develop and deploy AI applications.
