# Agentic IDEs

Agentic IDEs represent the next evolution of development environments, integrating AI capabilities directly into the coding workflow. These intelligent environments go beyond traditional code completion to provide proactive assistance, automated refactoring, and contextual understanding of codebases.

## What is an Agentic IDE?

An Agentic IDE is a development environment that:
- Understands code context and intent
- Proactively suggests improvements
- Can automate repetitive tasks
- Learns from developer interactions
- Integrates with development workflows

Popular Examples:

- [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)
- [Windsurf Cascade](https://windsurf.com/)
- [Zed](https://www.zed.dev/)
- [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/)

As of the time of writing each of these are all very close in feature sets though some excel in different areas. All currently support a free tier though as you start exploring agentic development you will likely run into the limits of the free tier.

## Key Features

While the features of agentic IDEs can vary, there are some common features that are typically available. These include rule/instruction files, workflows, and MCP servers (which were covered previously). All major agentic IDEs have native support for MCP servers.

| Feature | Description | Key Capabilities |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **Intelligent Code Completion** | Advanced code suggestions that understand context | • Context-aware suggestions<br>• Whole-line and multi-line completions<br>• API and documentation integration |
| **Automated Refactoring** | Tools to improve and modernize code | • Code quality improvements<br>• Pattern recognition and application<br>• Technical debt identification |
| **Natural Language Interfaces** | Conversational AI assistance for development tasks | • Conversational coding assistance<br>• Documentation generation<br>• Bug explanation and fixes |
| **Contextual Understanding** | Deep awareness of codebase structure and relationships | • Codebase awareness<br>• Dependency analysis<br>• Architectural insights |

### Rule/Instruction Files

Rule and instruction files standardize your team's development practices by embedding them directly into your codebase. These files (like `.rules` or `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) automatically inform AI assistants about your project's context and conventions.

Key aspects:

1. **Version-Controlled Standards**: Store coding conventions, architecture patterns, and documentation requirements in version control alongside your code. This ensures everyone works with the same guidelines and changes are tracked through code review.

2. **Structured Guidance**: Organize instructions in Markdown with clear sections for different concerns (coding standards, architecture, error handling). The AI uses this context to generate more relevant suggestions.

3. **Targeted Application**: Apply rules globally, per-language, or to specific paths. For example, React component patterns only apply to your frontend directory.

4. **Team Synchronization**: New team members immediately benefit from the collective knowledge embedded in these files, reducing onboarding time and maintaining consistency.

```markdown
# Project Standards

## JavaScript
- Use ES6+ features
- Prefer named exports
- Document public APIs with JSDoc

## React
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React Query for data fetching
- Implement error boundaries

## Error Handling
- Use custom error classes
- Log errors with context
- Provide user-friendly messages
```

This approach turns tribal knowledge into executable guidance that evolves with your codebase.

#### Best Practices

1. **Clarity and Specificity**
   - Keep instructions concise and specific
   - Use structured formatting (bullet points, numbered lists, sections)
   - Avoid vague or general instructions already built into AI models

2. **Organization**
   - Group related instructions using clear headings or XML-style tags
   - Prioritize the most important guidelines
   - Include specific examples where helpful

3. **Maintenance**
   - Keep instruction files updated as project conventions evolve
   - Version control instruction files alongside code
   - Review and refine based on AI output quality

#### Example Rulefile

```markdown
# Project Coding Standards

## General Guidelines
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Implement early returns to reduce nesting
- Add documentation for all public functions and classes

## Language-Specific Standards
- JavaScript: Use ES6+ features, avoid var, prefer const
- CSS: Follow BEM naming convention for classes
- Python: Follow PEP 8 style guide

## Architecture Patterns
- Implement repository pattern for data access
- Use dependency injection for service components
- Follow CQRS pattern for complex operations
```

Rulefiles for common tech stacks can be found at various online repositories and directories that share community-created instruction templates.

### Workflows

An emerging feature in agentic IDEs is the concept of workflows or prompt files. These files capture and automate common AI-assisted development patterns, allowing teams to standardize and version control their AI interactions.

Key benefits include:

- **Consistent Execution**: Ensure the same prompt structure and context is used every time (as consistent as you can get with a nondeterministic system)
- **Version Control**: Track changes to prompts and their evolution over time
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Share effective prompt patterns across the team
- **Reproducibility**: Maintain a history of what prompts produced which results

Example workflow file structure:

```yaml
# .prompts/generate-test.yaml
name: Generate Unit Test
description: Creates a unit test for the selected function
context:
  - current-file
  - test-file
prompt: |
  Write a comprehensive unit test for the following function.
  Focus on edge cases and error conditions.
  Use the testing framework from the existing test files.
  
  Function to test:
  {{selected_code}}
```

Workflows can be triggered through command palettes or custom keybindings, making complex AI-assisted patterns accessible to the entire team. This approach moves beyond one-off prompts to create reusable, maintainable AI interaction patterns that grow with your codebase.

## Exercise 1 - VSCode Vibing

Let's give agentic development a spin In this exercise we are going to put into practice what we have learned and build an MCP server with AI. AI writing tools to interface with AI whoa.

### Steps

1. Install VSCode and if you have access to Copilot paid plans log into that account (Check with your org or use an education account)
2. Seed the AI with the [MCP Full Text](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/llms-full.txt) and [Python MCP SDK](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/refs/heads/main/README.md) and brainstorm a spec
3. Convert the spec into a product requirements document
4. Iterate on the PRD committing frequently and practicing best agentic practices. It is a good idea to start with the smallest running MCP server then add functionality. Make sure you are testing frequently.
5. You can test your MCP server with the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector)
6. Register your MCP server with some MCP client (Claude Desktop, Windsurf, VSCode etc.) and try it out!

## Exercise 2 - Windsurf

Now let's experience another agentic IDE. Windsurf was an early mover in the agentic IDE space and in many ways has shaped the experience that is being mirrored in competitors. Go [here to download Windsurf](https://windsurf.com/).

Repeat the same exercise you did with VSCode but this time in Windsurf. Leverage the best practices you have learned and anything you learned along the way last time.

## Deliverables

- What worked well in the exercise?
- Which Agentic IDE did you like the most?
