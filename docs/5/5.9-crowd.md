## Exercise

> ##### Before starting exercise, make sure you have wget & Java 8 installed
	
Download Crowd

```
wget https://www.atlassian.com/software/crowd/downloads/binary/atlassian-crowd-2.11.0.tar.gz
```

Extract from the tar

```
tar -xvzf <atlassian file>
```

Created folder in /var/ for crowd

```
sudo mkdir /var/crowd-home
```

Remove the comment from the Unix crowd.home line in _[Atlassian install]/crowd-webapp/WEB-INF/classes/crowd-init.properties_.

Run the scripts to set up system

```
sh build.sh
sh start_crowd.sh
```

 - Open Google Chrome to [IP]:8095

 - [IP]:8095/crowd is where the initial setup begins

 - Create an evaluation license needed from Atlassian's website and use it in the system

 - Got Error "crowd.properties: permission denied"

 - The error was remedied after touching the file. It didn't exist and that is the error that comes from the file not existing

 - Chose new installation


# Deliverable
