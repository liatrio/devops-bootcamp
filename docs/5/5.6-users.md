# Users

In enterprise organizations, varying levels of access are necessary so while developers and engineers have privilages to destroy and change attributes as well as access to sensitive data. Others employees will have limited access to these attributes to not disrupt the work being done and keep sensitive information safe. In this exercise, we will have a Jenkins building a project from Bitbucket and deploying that to Tomcat. A few should be able to edit them, and the others should be able to only view the jenkins configurations.

## Jenkins Users:

1. Users that can create jobs
  - Joe and Justin are "admin level" users and have a lot of access - Initially the only ones who can create the jobs
2. Users that can login and see configuration but not edit - Everyone else
  - Shane, Eddie, Matt, Robert, Chris, Ben, Ravi, Dmitry
  - These users can only see the jobs and configuration you've created


## Bitbucket Users:
1. Users that can create repositories
  - Joe, Justin, Robert, Matt
2. Users that can only commit code
  - Ben, Chris, Ravi, Dmitry, Eddie, Shane
3. Create SSH keys for users to handle Bitbucket Git commits, etc.
  - Get keys working for Matt and Justin

## Working with the tools:
 Matt (and/or other team members) will create a repository in Bitbucket

Justin will:

  1. Create a build for the new repository
  2. Configure post-commit hooks for Jenkins-Bitbucket so that commits trigger builds (no polling)
  3. Create a scheduled deployment job to deploy the "most recent" build every four hours to Tomcat

Matt should be able to view the jobs and their configuration in Jenkins but not edit them

Other team users of Bitbucket will send SSH keys to the "admins" to have them managed for the users

# Deliverable

Have a Jenkins job build from a BitBucket repository, deploy to Tomcat, and have specific users able to edit the Jenkins configuration, and others users only able to view it.
