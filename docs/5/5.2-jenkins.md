# Jenkins

Jenkins is a self-contained, open source automation server which can be used to automate all sorts of tasks related to building, testing, and delivering or deploying software. Jenkins can be thought of as an orchestrator of tools, controlling the when and how of running tools.

You should already be familiar with using the Jenkins web GUI interface however when setting up a remote server there are instances where there are no interfaces to work with. This section will focus on using the Jenkins CLI to setup a new server and create jobs.

## Exercise

1. Setup a fresh Jenkins server.
2. Enable the Jenkins SSH server *Configure Global Security* / *SSH Server* and set SSHD Port to an unused port such as 2222. You may also need make port accessible to your localhost by port forwarding from your virtual machine or container and opening up the port in the firewall.
3. Add your public ssh key to your Jenkin user's configuration (*Manage Users* / YOUR USER / *Configure* / *SSH Public Keys*).
4. Download the [Jenkins' java CLI client](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/cli/) from your local server.
5. Run the help command `java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s JENKINS_URL -ssh -user USERNAME help` to look at the available commands.
6. Install the GitHub plugin with the Jenkins CLI.
7. Update Jenkins plugins using the Jenkins CLI. Note: You may need to get creative here :)
8. Clone and fork the spring-pet-clinic [project](https://github.com/liatrio/spring-petclinic).
9. Download [petclinic-simple-config.xml](files/petclinic-simple-config.xml).
10. Update the url field in the file to point to your Spring Pet Clinic fork.
11. Create the Jenkins job and verify it was created.

## Extended Exercise

1. Refer to the [Cli documentation](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/cli/) and run the Jenkins CLI commands using password authentication and executing the command via SSH instead of the Java client.
2. Experiment with other Jenkins commands.

# Deliverable

Discuss the importance of setting up Jenkins' jobs via a terminal with your group.
Discuss the implications using SSH vs password authentication with the CLI.
