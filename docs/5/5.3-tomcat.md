# Tomcat
In this section you will learn how to configure Tomcat. Tomcat is an open-source Java Servlet container developed by Apache, that provides a Java HTTP web server environment to run and test java code. To find out more about Tomcat, you can browse [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Tomcat).

## Setup Tomcat
1. Setup a new server using on your golden image.
2. Check that your software is up-to-date, and update anything that's needed.
3. Install and configure Tomcat to run on your server.

### Before moving on
Before continuing, make sure you have two separate servers, one running Jenkins, and one running Tomcat.

## Deploying from Jenkins to Tomcat
1. First, verify both servers are running by visiting the URLs of both.
2. Configure two Jenkins jobs, one which builds [spring-petclinic](https://github.com/liatrio/spring-petclinic) and a second which deploys the build artifacts to Tomcat using SCP.
3. Set up your jobs so that when the build job is complete, the deploy job is triggered automatically.
4. Visit your Tomcat server and confirm the project deployed correctly. You should be able to see the webapp in your browser.

## Extended Exercise
1. Try changing your setup to use a post build step instead of a second job.
2. Change your setup again to use a Maven plugin to deploy to Tomcat, as opposed to Jenkins.

Consider the benefits and drawbacks of each method you've used.

## Tips
- Jenkins extends its functionality with plugins, they may help with this section, but you can complete it without any.
- You will need to setup an SSH key for Jenkins to be able to access your Tomcat server.

# Deliverable
- A simple pipeline setup with Jenkins capable of delivering an artifact to Tomcat, where you can view the application.
- Discuss the benefits of using a tool like Tomcat in software development.
