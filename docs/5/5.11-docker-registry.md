# Docker Registry 

In this section we'll be learning about Docker Registry. As you've learned previously, Docker has an online image registy called Dockerhub, which allows users to store and download the Docker images they've created. 

In many situations though a buisiness might want to share their container images internally, but not have them stored on the public internet. In this case they could instead set up an internal Docker Registry to store their images.

## Setup a Docker Registry

This is a group exercise. If you are just one person, that's okay; we believe in you! However, try to complete this as a group if possible. 

1. Read this documentation on [Docker Registry](https://docs.docker.com/registry/)
2. Using the documentation, one person should set up Docker Registry, either on your own machine or a virtual machine.
3. Confirm that the registry can be accessed from the machine that it is running on.
4. On another machine, another person should try to access the registry remotely.
5. You may find that Docker will not connect to a Registry over an insecure connection, set up self signed certificates for the registry to use, using [this](https://docs.docker.com/registry/insecure/#use-self-signed-certificates) for guidance.
6. Confirm that you can connect to your registry from a remote machine.
