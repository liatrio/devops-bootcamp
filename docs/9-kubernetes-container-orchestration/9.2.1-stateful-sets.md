# 9.2.1 Stateful Sets

StatefulSets are a type of workload controller in Kubernetes specifically designed to manage stateful applications—applications that require persistent storage and stable identities for their Pods. Unlike Deployments, where Pods are interchangeable and ephemeral, StatefulSets provide “sticky” identities and guarantees that each Pod maintains a unique, stable network identity and persistent storage across rescheduling, scaling, and updates.

This stickiness is crucial for stateful workloads such as databases, message queues, and distributed systems, where each instance must maintain its state consistently and be reachable by other Pods in a predictable manner.

For more information, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/).

## Exercise 1 - Stateful Sets

1. Destroy and recreate a new cluster.
`unset KUBECONFIG; k3d cluster delete <cluster-name>; k3d cluster create <cluster-name>`.

2. Copy the contents of `random-num-pod.yaml` into a new file called `random-num-statefulset.yaml` and modify it to use a `StatefulSet` instead of a `Pod`. Set the number of replicas to 3.

> To prevent the container from dying and restarting, add a sleep command to the container:
 `args: ["shuf -i 0-100 -n 1 >> /opt/number.out; sleep 10000"]`.

?> [VolumeClaimTemplates](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#volume-claim-templates) give each statefulset replica an automatically managed, per-pod persistent volume that sticks to the Pod’s ordinal, avoids manual PVC creation, and prevents unsafe volume sharing.

3. Create a `Headless Service` for the `StatefulSet`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: <service-name>
spec:
  clusterIP: None 
  selector:
    app: <statefulset-label>
  ports:
  - port: <port>
    name: <port-name>
```

4. Apply the `StatefulSet` and `Service` to the cluster.

5. Exec into each pod and view the contents of `/opt/number.out` or use the command:
```shell
kubectl get pods -l app=<statefulset-label> -o name | xargs -I {} sh -c 'echo {}; kubectl exec {} -- cat /opt/number.out'
```

6. Delete one of the pods from the `StatefulSet`, run the command again and observe the output.

?> Notice that deleting the pod may take a while to actually terminate. Take note on why you think this is the case.

## Deliverables

- Look into other workload controllers (Deployments, ReplicaSets, DaemonSets, etc.), what are the differences between them? Why might you use one over the other?
- Why did you need to create a `Headless Service` for your `StatefulSet`?
- What are some downsides to using `StatefulSets`?
