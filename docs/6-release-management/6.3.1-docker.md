# Dockerhub

Similar to more traditional software artifacts, containerized application images are usually deployed to a centralized repository when they are released. From the repository they can be deployed into runtime environments or consumed as dependencies for other applications.

[Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/) is the defacto default container registry for Docker. In short, this means that Dockerhub provides repositories to create, manage, and find container images.

## Exercise

1. If you haven't already, create a [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/) account, and create your first two repositories, name them `dks_ui` and `dks_api`.

2. Fork the two DevOps Knowledge Share repositories from before, the [UI](https://github.com/liatrio/dks-ui) and [API](https://github.com/liatrio/dks-api).

3. Using two different `Dockerfiles` build two container images. Make sure to [tag](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/tag/) the images using semantic versioning.

> **_Note:_** Be sure to add the environment variable "KNOWLEDGE_SHARE_API" to the UI container with the value of the API container's URL. Another option is to add it to the Docker compose file mentioned below.

?> You can tag a Docker image in the same step as the build.

4. Push both images to your Dockerhub repository.

5. Create a `Docker Compose` to be able to connect the frontend and the backend.

?> Although this example project does not include an external database to configure, take some time to look at one like MongoDB and how to configure it in a Docker Compose file.

6. Create a GitHub Actions Workflow to automatically build and push your Docker images to your repository.

?> You can advance your Self-Hosted GitHub Actions runner from previous chapters to be able to run Docker in Docker, however this is a more complex task.  It is worth knowing how to do, but it is also worth knowing how to use existing actions from the GitHub Actions ecosystem.

## GitHub Container Registry

A popular alternative to Dockerhub is using GitHub Container Registry. GitHub Container Registry is similar to Dockerhub, but has a few differences. For one, since Dockerhub is the default container registry, no additional information is needed when you `pull` or `push` an image. Also, Dockerhub is more lenient with container size and usage, whereas GitHub Container Registry is typically better suited for organizations who want to manage access to container images in a centralized location. Lastly, GitHub Container Registry may be a better choice if you are using GitHub Actions.

One thing to note is that Dockerhub provides GitHub integration, where Dockerhub will build and publish an image after a commit to GitHub.

# Deliverable

- Discuss the benefits of using a container registry, and how image releases work.

- Discuss use cases for public vs private container repositories.
