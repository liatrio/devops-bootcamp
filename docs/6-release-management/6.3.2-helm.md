# Helm

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes. Helm packages are called charts, which are collections of files that describe Kubernetes resources. Helm Charts are used to manage installing, and upgrading complex Kubernetes applications.

Helm charts are composed of Kubernetes resource templates and metadata used to render the templates and create the resource in a Kubernetes cluster. We can create Helm charts by writing resource templates and metadata as YAML files. The required files that Helm will work with are `values.yaml` and `Chart.yaml`. The chart.yaml define the general description of the chart and the values.yaml define the values that are used in the templates. The Helm chart contains a `/templates` folder with Kubernetes resource definitions. Helm will iterate through these definition files and apply them to the Kubernetes cluster.

Review the [chart template developers guide](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/#the-chart-template-developers-guide) for more information on creating Helm charts.

## Exercise 1

In this exercise we will get started by installing Helm and creating, installing and updating a basic chart with a ConfigMap Kubernetes resource.

1. [Install Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

2. Create a new Helm chart following this [chart file structure](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/) and add the required fields to the `Chart.yaml`.

?> Do not use `helm create` for this exercise.

3. Add a `configmap.yaml` file to the templates folder and define a ConfigMap Kubernetes resource with some data.

?> Review the [Kubernetes ConfigMaps docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/) to find a description and example of ConfigMap resources

4. Run `helm lint .` to check the syntax of your helm chart.

5. Run `helm install configmap .` to install the Helm chart and create the ConfigMap resource to the Kubernetes cluster.

?> To view the state of the Helm chart you just installed you can run `helm list -a`

6. Run `kubectl get configmap NAME -o yaml` to see the yaml that is applied from the Helm install step. Also use `kubectl describe` to view the ConfigMap and compare the results.

7. Run `helm template .` to show the entire output that Helm is creating for you.

8. Add a key with a string value to `values.yaml`. Update `configmap.yaml` to use that value as a value in the ConfigMap data.

?> Review the [Values Files](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/values_files/) section of the Chart Template Guide for additional information.

9. Run `helm upgrade NAME .` to apply the changes.

10. Use `helm` and `kubectl` to verify your changes.

## Exercise 2

In this exercise we will take an existing Helm chart which deploys the [DevOps Knowledge Share API](https://github.com/liatrio/dks-api).

1. If you haven't already, clone the DevOps Bootcamp git repo on your local machine. This exercise will build off of the Helm chart in the `examples/ch6/helm/DKS` folder.

2. Modify the `values.yaml` to pull the DKS API image that you pushed to GHCR from the previous section.

?> How is the backend image value set in `values.yaml` used in the charts templates?

3. Install the Helm Chart and use `kubectl` to verify the Pod created by the Helm chart is using your DKS API image and check the status of the Pod.

?> You can use `kubectl logs` to view the pod logs.

## Exercise 3

In this exercise we will add a Kubernetes deployment, service, and configmap to our Helm chart to deploy the DKS frontend application.

1. Clone [dks-ui](https://github.com/liatrio/dks-ui) if you haven't already. Run `make docker-build` and push the resulting image to GHCR.

2. Add `deployment-frontend.yaml`, `service-frontend.yaml`, and `configmap-frontend.yaml` files to the templates folder. Use the existing `service-backend.yaml`, `dks-global-config.yaml`, and `deployment-backeng.yaml` as reference. Your configmap will need to set the following [environment variables](https://github.com/liatrio/dks-ui/blob/fed75825d4816504753883319e0c0a121f92fa51/.env.template)

3. Add values to `values.yaml` to configure your frontend deployment and service.

4. Run `helm upgrade NAME . ` to apply the Helm chart changes and add the new frontend resources to Kubernetes.

5. Port forward the frontend service port to your local machine.

?> The notes output when you ran `helm install` should have some useful hints :)

6. Open the frontend application in a web browser and verify it is communicating with the backend service.

?> Running into issues getting the frontend to communicate with the backend? Read about [Kubernetes service discovery](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#discovering-services).

## Exercise 4

In this exercise we will convert a Kubernetes deployment definition into a Helm chart. Helm charts can call out other helm chart definitions using `apiVersion`. In this exercise we will be calling out [GitHub's official chart for a GitHub Actions runner](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller/blob/master/charts/actions-runner-controller/crds/actions.summerwind.dev_runners.yaml), and our chart will define the deployment and customized values for the runner.

?> We need to first take care of some prerequisites for deploying a GitHub runner to a cluster.

1. [Prerequisite for GH runner on Kubernetes:](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller/blob/master/docs/quickstart.md#prerequisites) Install cert-manager in your cluster
```zsh
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.8.2/cert-manager.yaml
```
> `note:` This command uses v1.8.2. Please replace with a later version, if available.

2. [Prerequisite for GH runner on Kubernetes:](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller/blob/master/docs/quickstart.md#prerequisites) Install GitHub action controller to the cluster

    1. Create a GitHub personal access token with repo access (save locally for sub-step 3).
    2. Add helm repo for GitHub action controller (ARC)
```zsh
helm repo add actions-runner-controller https://actions-runner-controller.github.io/actions-runner-controller
```
    3. Install Helm chart (*make sure to replace the "REPLACE_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" with the token you created in sub-step 1*)

```zsh
helm upgrade --install --namespace actions-runner-system --create-namespace \
--set=authSecret.create=true \
--set=authSecret.github_token="REPLACE_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
--wait actions-runner-controller actions-runner-controller/actions-runner-controller
```

> Now we can start the Helm chart conversion.

3. Create a new helm chart with `helm create`. Once you have created a helm chart, it will contain a templates folder, a templates/tests folder, a charts folder, a values.yaml, and a chart.yaml. To keep this exercise simple and clean, delete all files and directories except for the following:
   - Chart.yaml
   - values.yaml
   - .helmignore
   - templates/_helpers.tpl
   - templates/deployment.yaml
   > *we won't need the rest since the use of the GitHub chart only requires us to define the deployment*

4. Replace the contents of the `templates/deployment.yaml` with the GitHub definition for a [runner deployment](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller/blob/master/docs/quickstart.md#deploy-and-configure-arc) and delete the contents of the values.yml file.

```yaml
apiVersion: actions.summerwind.dev/v1alpha1
kind: RunnerDeployment
metadata:
  name: example-runnerdeploy
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    spec:
      repository: mumoshu/actions-runner-controller-ci
```

5. Define the following values in the `values.yaml` and replace the hard coded values in the `deployment.yaml` for calls to value sets in the `values.yaml`.
   - A value definition for `repository` with a value set to the GitHub repository path you plan to use the runner in.
   - A value definition for `labels` with a value set to a label of your choosing (*this label will be used for the GitHub workflow*). ex: `self-hosted` as a label.

  ?> This `labels` definition will need to be added to the deployment.yaml under `spec`,`template`, `spec`. It will be inline with `repository`. It is not provided by default in GitHub's example.

5. Use helm commands to install your runner deployment.

?> Helm install has a --dry-run option which will output the potential configuration without deploying. Run this to see if your configuration is how you want it.

6. Use Kubectl to look at the current pods which should contain the configured GitHub self-hosted runner pod. You can also use `kubectl get runner` to look at any `runner` resources.

7. Update workflow in your repository assigned to the runner so the workflow runs a echo Hello World command. (*here is where you can use the label defined in the deployment for your workflow definition*)
   - You should also be able to see the runner within the repo settings. (clicking on the runner will give you the workflow yaml definition for the runner)
