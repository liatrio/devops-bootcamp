## Go Releaser

[Go Releaser](https://goreleaser.com/install/) is a tool for releasing and publishing Go Projects. It is meant to be used with CI Tools as a way to simplify the process of releasing the built Go Binaries into a GitHub/GitLab release. Go Releaser leverages a `.goreleaser.yml` file to customize what will be built and archived.

## Exercise

1. Find an Open Source Go Project to fork.

?> This is a good list of [Trending Go Projects](https://github.com/trending/go)

2. Create a GitHub Actions workflow for your fork that builds the project and then uses `Go Releaser` to deploy the project as a `GitHub Release`.

?> Ensure your build environment has the minimum version of Go required for the project you're building

## Deliverable

Discuss the differences between Maven releases and Go Releaser. Discuss any problems you had getting this exercise done.
