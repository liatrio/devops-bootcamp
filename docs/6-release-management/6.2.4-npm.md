# Npm

Npm is similar to Maven in that it provides a central document that determines the various SDLC phases (pom or package.json). Both provide ways to explicitly manage dependencies and their versions using SemVer. The primary differences lie in the two languages that they support, as Javascript doesn't need to be compiled the same way that Java does.

Read [About npm](https://www.npmjs.com/about), [What is npm?](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm), and [Working with package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/using-a-package.json).

Watch [this introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3aKRdUyr0s).

Go over the rest of the [npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com).

## Commands

Research the following commands as well as the `-g` option.

- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- `npm test`

## SemVer

?> Watch [Semantic versioning and npm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK4Meix58R4) on YouTube.

## Example Express JS Application

1. Follow the Instructions to setup a simple Express JS Application [Express JS Documentation](https://expressjs.com/).

2. Make some test for the application by utilizing jest for the testing [Jest Documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started). Make a simple test and verify that the test passed.

3. Make the following scripts in the package.json file

```json
"scripts": {
   "start": "node app.js",
   "test": "jest"
}
```

4. Start the App with `npm start`.

5. Run the test script you just made and make sure your application meets code structure standards.

## Deliverables
