# Azure Virtual Machines

In this section we will demonstrate how to create a virtual machine instance in Azure from a marketplace image and perform configuration using a cloud-init script.

> [Cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is an industry standard multi-distribution method for cross-platform cloud instance initialization. It is supported across all major public cloud providers, provisioning systems for private cloud infrastructure, and bare-metal installations.

## Create an Azure VM from a marketplace image and configure with cloud-init

1. Log into Azure CLI and select the correct subscription.

2. Use Azure CLI to list VM images available in your Azure region that are based on Ubuntu Linux.

3. Create a cloud-init script that installs NGINX and a simple Node.js application. Copy and paste this config file into a .txt file, you will need this later.

```yaml
#cloud-config
package_update: true
package_upgrade: true
packages:
  - nginx
  - nodejs
  - npm
write_files:
  - owner: www-data:www-data
  - path: /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
    content: |
      server {
        listen 80;
        location / {
          proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
          proxy_http_version 1.1;
          proxy_set_header Upgrade \$http_upgrade;
          proxy_set_header Connection keep-alive;
          proxy_set_header Host \$host;
          proxy_cache_bypass \$http_upgrade;
        }
      }
  - owner: azureuser:azureuser
  - path: /home/azureuser/bootcamp/index.js
    content: |
      var express = require('express')
      var app = express()
      var os = require('os');
      app.get('/', function (req, res) {
        res.send('DevOps Bootcamp sample app running on host ' + os.hostname() + '!')
      })
      app.listen(3000, function () {
        console.log('Test app listening on port 3000!')
      })
runcmd:
  - service nginx restart
  - cd "/home/azureuser/bootcamp"
  - npm init
  - npm install express -y
  - nodejs index.js
```

5. Generate some temporary SSH keys to use for the new VM. You can use the SSH key from your machine as well if you'd like.

5. Create a resource group from Azure CLI.

6. Create a VM using Azure CLI that uses the cloud-init script you created from step 3.

```bash
az vm -h
```

?> It might take several minutes for cloud-init to install packages and perform updates. This is especially true for small instance sizes!

?> You may need to pass in the config file as base64 encoded

7. Use Azure CLI to get the public IP for your new VM. For bonus points, use Azure CLI query commands to assign the public IP into a variable we can use in subsequent steps. You can [look here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/vm?view=azure-cli-latest) for VM specific CLI command references.

8. Make sure you can SSH into the VM using the private key from step 5.

9. When the VM was deployed a default NSG was attached to the VM's NIC. Use Azure CLI to open up web traffic to the VM.

10. Test you can reach the website using cURL.

```bash
curl -w '\n' http://$PUBLIC_IP
```

11. Cleanup by deleting the resource group.

## Deliverables

- Are there other ways to authenticate with a virtual machine instance other than using already generated ssh keys?
- What is cloud-init, and why is it an industry standard?
- What are the specific Azure CLI query commands that can be used to assign the public IP into a variable?
- How can the process be automated or streamlined for efficient deployment and management?
