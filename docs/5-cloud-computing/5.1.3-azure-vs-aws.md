# AWS vs Azure

There are many similarities between cloud services provided by Azure and AWS, such that if you have a deep understanding of one platform, learning the other won't be a significant leap.

## Service Mapping

In many cases there is a 1:1 mapping between services across AWS and Azure. One could surmise that after AWS launches a new service that a similar service will appear in Azure some months later, likely with a similar sounding name.

| AWS | Azure |
| --- | --- |
| VPC | VNET |
| EC2 | Virtual Machines |
| Auto Scaling | VM Scale Sets |
| ECS | ACI |
| EKS | AKS |
| Lambda | Functions |
| CodeDeploy, CodeCommit, CodePipline | DevOps |
| Route53 | DNS, Traffic Manager |
| Direct Connect | ExpressRoute |
| Network Load Balancer | Load Balancer |
| Application Load Balancer | Application Gateway |
| IAM | Azure AD |

## Enterprise Considerations

Microsoft has an extensive history of providing solutions within on-premise data centers and launched Azure public cloud services in 2010, nearly 4 years after Amazon launched AWS. While Azure had a late start compared to AWS, many clients that already use Microsoft products and services on-premise may see Azure as the path of least resistance to cloud adoption, without the need to introduce a new vendor. This is especially true for clients already using the Office 365 ecosystem for collaboration.

As of January 2024, AWS has 32% of the market, followed by Azure at 23%, and Google at 10%.
