# Networking Basics
Since this boot camp is designed for all levels of experience, this section is here to give the basics of networking that you will need to move forward with the next sections of the boot camp.
In networking, a port is an endpoint of communication. Physical as well as wireless connections are terminated at ports of hardware devices. At the software level, within an operating system, a port is a logical construct that identifies a specific process or a type of network service.

During this boot camp a vast majority of the exercises will involve being able to connect with the application running either locally or on AWS. Some important ports to remember are SSH on port 22, port 80 is http, 443 is TCP, and 1024-49,151 are user registered ports which can be made available for the user’s needs.

When you are running an application locally in order to reach the application you will need to access the port via localhost. The IP address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for loopback and is more commonly referred to as localhost. For example, if you wanted to reach Jenkins running locally on your machine you could open a browser and enter 127.0.0.1:8080 or localhost:8080.

Private ip ranges:
Knowing these ranges and what each of them means will help you to troubleshoot networking issues in the future.

Routing Tables:
A table stored in a router that maps the routes to an IP for a particular destination.
