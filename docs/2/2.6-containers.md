# Containers

>&ldquo;Containers and virtual machines have similar resource isolation and allocation benefits, but function differently because containers virtualize the operating system instead of hardware. Containers are more portable and efficient.&rdquo;

Read more from [Docker: What is a Container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container) to get a better understanding of containers and how they compare to virtual hosts.

## Docker

Docker is a platform to create, run and manage containers and container resources (images, networks and data volumes). It consists of a server, a REST API and a CLI client to interact with the API.

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install)

> ### Note
Docker Desktop on OSX limits the amount of resources containers can use by default. If you experience performance issues with resource intensive containers make sure to increase the resources available. `Docker Desktop icon` -> `Preferences` -> `Advanced`

### Images and Containers
>&ldquo;An image is an executable package that includes everything needed to run an application--the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files.&rdquo; - [Docker Concepts](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/#docker-concepts)

>&ldquo;A container is a runtime instance of an image--what the image becomes in memory when executed (that is, an image with state, or a user process).&rdquo; - [Docker Concepts](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/#docker-concepts)

Images are the base building blocks in Docker. They define what is in a containers. They can be used by other images to extended extend their functionality. Images can also be shared across hosts.

### Running Containers

Run the hello world container `docker run hello-world`

This deceptively simple command actually does a lot which is explained by the output of the container.

If the Docker image hello-world does not exist in the local image repository it downloads it from Docker Hub and adds it to the local repository. You can use `docker images` to list the locally installed images. You will see the hello-world image in this list. You can download or update an image without running a container with `docker pull <IMAGE NAME>`.

Once the hello-world image is available it creates and runs a container based on the image. Images define the default command that is run when the container is started. When the command exists the container stops. You can list running and stopped containers with `docker ps -a`.

Note that it has automatically generated a name for the container since we did not specify one. What happens to the images and containers if you run `docker run hello-world` again?

### Dockerhub

[Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/) is an online docker image registry where users can upload their ready-built images, or pull down images uploaded by the docker community. Similarly to atlas for Vagrant boxes, dockerhub is driven by it's users. If there isn't an image available with the features you want, you can make one and upload it yourself.

### Building Custom Images

A Dockerfile is a simple text file which defines how the image is built. The Dockerfile specifies a base image that is the starting point for the resulting image and a series of commands which create layers that are applied to the base image. After all of the layers are applied, the image is saved to your machine's local image registry.

See [Docker: Define a container with Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/part2/#define-a-container-with-dockerfile) for an example Dockerfile.

To build an image run `docker build -t IMAGE_NAME .` in the same directory as the Dockerfile.

#### Best Practices

The following best practices are part of a philosophy for containers which make them scale horizontally easier, be more reusable and deploy quicker.

 - Ephemeral Containers: A container should, as much as possible, be able to be stopped and destroyed, then rebuilt and replaced with an absolute minimum set up and configuration.
 - Decouple Applications: A container should have only one concern.

See [Docker: Dockerfile Best Practices](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/) for more best practices regarding performance and optimization.

### Cleaning Up

You can remove stopped containers with `docker rm CONTAINER_ID|NAME`.

You can remove images which do not have any containers with `docker image rm IMAGE_ID|NAME`.

# Exercise

Create a Jenkins and Nexus container from custom images similar to the virtual machines you created using VirtialBox and configure them to deploy spring-petclinic from Jenkins to Nexus.

# Deliverable

Discuss the advantages / disadvantages of using containers vs. virtual machines.

Discuss some possible challenges of using Containers in an enterprise production environment.
