# Copilot Mini-Workshop

This exercise assumes that you are using visual studio code (although it can be used in many IDE's like NeoVim or Zed), and have enabled the Github Copilot vscode extension.  https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/getting-started

Copilot functionality can be broken down into two categories:
* Code completion/prediction
* Code chat/explanation

## Copilot in Action: The Basics

For a basic understanding of how to use Copilot, start by going through the basics section in [Liatrio's Github Copilot Workshop](https://copilot.liatr.io/basics/).  This will give you an introduction to the core features, such as Agents, Slash Commands, and Context Variables, then walk you through the process of creating a new project with Copilot.

## Copilot in Action: Feature Development

Now that you have a basic understanding of how to use Copilot, you can start using it to develop features in an existing project.

We are going to be using the  app for this exercise.
