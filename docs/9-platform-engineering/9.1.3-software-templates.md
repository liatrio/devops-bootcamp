    - name: Create a simple template
      description: |
        This exercise involves writing a custom Software Template and configuring Backstage to register it as an entity that can be used from the UI, and then using the template to publish a new repo in a GitHub organization.  This can be achieved by following two separate guides in Spotify's official Backstage docs: one for writing the Software Template, and the other for providing Backstage with the necessary permissions to publish new GitHub repos using the Template.  Some extra time is allotted for misc. debugging, since it seems that Backstage is in a transitory period and there's no telling whether their guides will remain accurate.

        Students are to become acquainted with the Scaffold plugin and extend this plugin by writing a custom action which can be used in the custom template they wrote in the previous exercise.  Some special instructions are provided because the only available official guides are outdated.

# Software Templates

EXPLAIN TEMPLATES

### Exercise 1: Create a GitHub Organization

Backstage integrates heavily with SCM software as it is designed to be a 'single pane of glass' into an organization's development ecosystem. So to mimic that we will need
a GitHub org to play around with. Each person going through the bootcamp will need their own GitHub Organization.

1. Follow [GitHubs docs](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch) and create a new Organization (Free)


### Exercise 2: Write a custom action

EXPLAIN THE SCAFFOLD PLUGIN

> Please make sure that your Backstage instance can automatically pull Users from the GitHub organization you created.  In that light, consider looking into Backstage organizational data for authenticating with *Github* as a provider.

1. Configure Backstage to authenticate with GitHub
> Do not store secrets in plain text that will be pushed to your remote repo!
2. Add GitHub Authentication to the sign-in page
3. Verify that you can login via GitHub

## Deliverables

- By completing the above exercises, participants will gain hands-on experience setting up and navigating Spotify's Backstage.
- What did Backstage need in order to leverage the built-in sign-in resolver for GitHub?
- Discuss pros and cons of using an org's developer platform (GitHub/GitLab) as the sign-in authentication method for their IDP (Backstage).
