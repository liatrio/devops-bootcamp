      description: |
        Students will set up a local instance of Backstage by following the official Getting Started guide. This exercise covers starting the local instance, familiarizing with the UI, and customizing the appearance of the Backstage instance including logo and application name changes. Extra credit is given for applying a custom theme. The customized instance should then be pushed to a repo in the newly created GitHub Organization.

      description: |
        This exercise focuses on configuring authentication for the Backstage instance using GitHub. Students will create an OAuth app within their GitHub Organization and integrate it with Backstage for authentication purposes. This includes not storing secrets in plain text and ensuring secure authentication practices. Verification of login functionality through GitHub is the final step to confirm successful integration.

# Backstage

Platform teams are responsible for managing an organization's IDP. As mentioned in the overview section this software can be an API, CLI, or GUI but needs to offer teams self-service tools that adhere to the company's best practices and standards.

In March 2020 Spotify open sourced their internal developer platform Backstage and donated the project to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Backstage is a web app that is designed to serve as a 'one stop shop' for all your developer needs. Through its key features of the Software Catalog, Templates, and TechDocs users can get a detailed overview of an organization's technology landscape, easily discover internal projects and documentation, and use a simplified process to create new projects that adhere to the company's standards.

## Backstage's Design

Backstage is a monorepo React application that is written in TypeScript, and is constructed out of three parts.

![Parts of backstage](https://backstage-spotify-com.spotifycdn.com/_next/static/media/IMG_key_terms.72c69cd1.png ':class=img-center :alt=parts of backstage')

**Core:** This is the base functionality that is developed and maintained by the Open Source team.

**App:** This is the instance of the app that is deployed and customized for the user's needs. The app is the part that is generally maintained by a Platform team.

**Plugins:** Plugins are the primary method of customization for a Backstage instance. These can be community sourced or internally developed and extend the functionality of the Backstage app.

The Core components of a Backstage app are: Web component which is what the user interfaces with, a Backend service which powers the plugins of Backstage and the Database layer which stores plugin specific data.

## Key Features

Backstage comes with a few key features (really just plugins); they are the following:

**Software Catalog:** The Software Catalog is a comprehensive inventory system within Backstage that tracks ownership, metadata, and relationships of all software components across an organization, facilitating easier discovery and management of services, libraries, and more.

**TechDocs:** TechDocs in Backstage serve as an integrated knowledge hub, where teams can create, store, and access technical documentation alongside their code, enabling seamless collaboration and information sharing across the organization.

**Software Templates:** Software Templates in Backstage provide standardized scaffolding for creating new projects, ensuring that all new software adheres to organizational best practices and standards, thereby streamlining the development process and fostering consistency.

**Plugins:** Plugins are modular extensions within Backstage that enhance its functionality, allowing teams to customize and integrate additional features and services, such as CI/CD, monitoring, and cloud services, tailored to their specific workflow needs.

### Exercise 1: Create a GitHub Organization

Backstage integrates heavily with SCM software as it is designed to be a 'single pane of glass' into an organization's development ecosystem. So to mimic that we will need
a GitHub org to play around with. Each person going through the bootcamp will need their own GitHub Organization.

1. Follow [GitHubs docs](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch) and create a new Organization (Free)

### Exercise 2: Stand up a Local Instance of Backstage

1. Follow Backstage's official [Getting Started](https://backstage.spotify.com/learn/standing-up-backstage/standing-up-backstage/1-intro/) guide
> Skip setting up the PostgresSQL instance
2. Start your local instance of Backstage and get familiar with the UI
3. Customize the look and feel of your Backstage instance
    - Change the logo
    - Change the application name
    - Deep Dive: Apply a custom theme
4. Push your instance of Backstage to a repo in your new GitHub Organization

> By default, your Backstage instance will be configured to use SQLite to store data in-memory. If you would like your instance's data to be stored to your disc, you can specify a local folder in your `app-config.yaml` as follows:
  ```  database:
    client: better-sqlite3
    # sqlite is configured by default to store in-memory
    connection: # ':memory:'
      directory: 'abs/path/to/this-directory/data/backstage.sqlite'
```

### Exercise 3: Configure Authentication via GitHub

Currently your Backstage instance is not authenticating the user. You are an anonymous guest. Given that an IDP will have access to all the engineering resources in an organization and have access to self-service resources we need to add authentication. Backstage's authentication system serves a couple of purposes. First it is there for sign-in functionality and to authenticate the user. Additionally it can be used to grant access to third-party resources. Typically you will use one authentication provider for sign-in functionality and other authentication providers will be used to grant access to third-party resources.

> Please make sure that your Backstage instance can automatically pull Users from the GitHub organization you created.  In that light, consider looking into Backstage organizational data for authenticating with *Github* as a provider.

1. Configure Backstage to authenticate with GitHub
> Do not store secrets in plain text that will be pushed to your remote repo!
2. Add GitHub Authentication to the sign-in page
3. Verify that you can login via GitHub

## Deliverables

- By completing the above exercises, participants will gain hands-on experience setting up and navigating Spotify's Backstage.
- What did Backstage need in order to leverage the built-in sign-in resolver for GitHub?
- Discuss pros and cons of using an org's developer platform (GitHub/GitLab) as the sign-in authentication method for their IDP (Backstage).
