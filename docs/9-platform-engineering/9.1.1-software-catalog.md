      description: |
        This exercise instructs students to register an entity to their local Backstage instance.  The entity should correspond to a repo belonging to a GitHub organization that the student owns.  This exercise will require students to configure their Backstage instance to have the permissions needed to access their GitHub organization and will help pave the way for the following exercise.

        Students will configure their Backstage instance to automatically perform read operations on a given GitHub organization and ingest `catalog-info.yaml` files existing in that organization in order to automatically register entities.  They will need to configure GitHub as a catalog and ensure that their Backstage instance combs their organization for the correct file(s) at an appropriate interval.

# Backstage Software Catalog

Around 2010, Spotify experienced a period of intense growth.  Of course, as the company grew, so did their infrastructure, and as their infrastructure grew, it became increasingly more complex and fragmented.  This led to developers having to spend more time each day following bread crumb trails to track down answers to questions like, "Where is the documentation for this service?" and "This service isn't responding -- who was the last person to work on it?", and the constant cognitive overload and context switching soon became overwhelming.  

To solve this problem, Spotify created Backstage, central to which is the Software (aka Service) Catalog, which allows developers to visit one centralized location in order to find everything they need to know about their organization's infrastructure.  The Catalog is designed to track ownership and metadata for each individual piece of software in an organization so that users can understand the role it plays in the organization's software ecosystem.

Please read more about it on the [Backstage website](https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/).

### Exercise 1: Register an Entity to Backstage

In Backstage, entities represent different types of resources within your system.  They are defined using YAML files and registered in the Backstage catalog.  Each entity type has a specific purpose and schema.  

1. Following Backstage's [Getting Started](https://backstage.spotify.com/learn/standing-up-backstage/putting-backstage-into-action/8-integration/) guide, add a GitHub integration to your Backstage instance.

  ?> These instructions use a personal access token to authenticate Backstage with GitHub, but you may also use a [GitHub App](https://backstage.io/docs/integrations/github/github-apps).  

2. Continue following the above guide to manually register a component entity to your Backstage instance.  *You may find it helpful for future exercises to take note of the information that is provided alongside your components in the UI, and consider where it comes from.*

### Exercise 2: Configure Automatic Catalog Ingestion

While manually registering entities is fairly straightforward, it wouldn't make much sense to do this for a system made up of any more than a few components because it would quickly become tedious and time-consuming.  Thankfully there is a way to automate this process.  We can set up Backstage to periodically inspect a given location, such as GitHub, for information that it can use to automatically generate these entities.  

1. Configure your Backstage instance to automatically register entities based on repos that it detects within a GitHub organization that you own.  

  ?> See [GitHub Discovery](https://backstage.io/docs/integrations/github/discovery/) for a useful guide.

### Exercise 3: Generate a Dependency Graph

Hopefully you enjoyed the contrast between manually and automatically registering entities.  In a similar vein, another useful feature of Backstage is its ability to leverage `catalog-info.yaml` files to automatically generate dependency graphs depicting the relationship between entities in a software ecosystem.  The visual aid provided by these graphs can help users quickly understand complex systems.  For example, if a developer needs to make a change to a particular service, they can look at that service's dependency graph to know what (and who) else might be affected by such a change.

1. Fork the [dks-ui](https://github.com/liatrio/dks-ui) and [dks-api](https://github.com/liatrio/dks-api) repos into a GitHub organization that you own.
2. Add or modify each repo's `catalog-info.yaml` to define its relationship to the other repo.  In other words, we want to be sure that each entity references the other.
3. Verify that within your Backstage instance, each of the two entities' dependency graphs shows a relation to the other entity.

### Exercise 4: Generate an OpenAPI Definition

The OpenAPI Specifications provide a formal standard for describing HTTP APIs.  Following this standard provides many advantages, including helping people to systematically understand how a given API works on its own and in relation to other APIs, and allowing client code to be automatically generated which can correctly interact with the API.  

Backstage can take advantage of the latter benefit by automatically ingesting OpenAPI spec files and generating OpenAPI definitions in the Software Catalog.  Backstage will also link these definitions to their respective API entities so that users can quickly understand and use APIs in their organization.  Cool!

1. If you haven't already, fork a repo containing source code for an API.
2. If the repo doesn't already have one, generate an `openapi.json` or `openapi.yaml` file.

  ?> If you're using `dks-api`, see `README.md` for an endpoint that will allow you to generate an OpenAPI spec.

3. Verify that your Backstage instance has an API entity representing your repo with a corresponding well formatted definition.

## Deliverables

- How does Backstage's Software Catalog relate to The Three Ways?
- When (if ever) might it make sense to manually register an entity to Backstage?
- What are some benefits and disadvantages of Backstage's Software Catalog feature?
- What are some of the main types of entities in Backstage and how are they related to each other?
- How can one effectively use the Software Catalog to track a highly complex software ecosystem, e.g., one consisting of thousands of services?  What if the ecosystem is already in place before implementing the Software Catalog?
