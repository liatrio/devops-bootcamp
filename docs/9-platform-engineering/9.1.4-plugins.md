        Students receive an introduction to Backstage's plugin directory by adding a plugin from the directory to their Backstage instance.  They are encouraged to look through the plugin's source code and gain a basic understanding of how it works.

        Students will configure their Backstage instance to automatically perform read operations on a given GitHub organization and ingest `catalog-info.yaml` files existing in that organization in order to automatically register entities.  They will need to configure GitHub as a catalog and ensure that their Backstage instance combs their organization for the correct file(s) at an appropriate interval.

# Backstage Plugins

Backstage is a single-page application composed of a set of plugins*.    The fact that any number of these tools can easily be added to or removed from a Backstage app enables a modular design pattern, making Backstage apps highly extensible and easy to customize. 

**In this context, “plugin” is meant as a flexible definition for a wide variety of infrastructure or software development tools.*

### Exercise 1: Explore the Plugin Directory

The [Plugin directory](https://backstage.io/plugins/) has a good number of open source plugins you can add to your Backstage instance (not to mention the core feature plugins, some of which we used in previous sections).

1. 

2. Continue following the above guide to manually register a component entity to your Backstage instance.  *You may find it helpful for future exercises to take note of the information that is provided alongside your components in the UI, and consider where it comes from.*

### Exercise 2: Write a Custom Plugin

Well, it's the end of the chapter and you probably saw this coming, but it's time to write your own custom plugin.  

1. Fork the [dks-ui](https://github.com/liatrio/dks-ui) and [dks-api](https://github.com/liatrio/dks-api) repos into a GitHub organization that you own.
2. Add or modify each repo's `catalog-info.yaml` to define its relationship to the other repo.  In other words, we want to be sure that each entity references the other.
3. Verify that within your Backstage instance, each of the two entities' dependency graphs shows a relation to the other entity.

?> As of 2024, Backstage has a fairly active [Discord server](https://discord.com/servers/backstage-687207715902193673) which could be a great place to reach out for guidance.
