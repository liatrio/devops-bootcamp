# Backstage Plugins

Backstage is a single-page application composed of a set of plugins*.    The fact that any number of these tools can easily be added to or removed from a Backstage app enables a modular design pattern, making Backstage apps highly extensible and easy to customize.

**In this context, “plugin” is meant as a flexible definition for a wide variety of infrastructure or software development tools.*

### Exercise 1: Explore the Plugin Directory

The [Plugin directory](https://backstage.io/plugins/) has a good number of open source plugins you can add to your Backstage instance (not to mention the core feature plugins, some of which we used in previous sections).

1. Continue following the above guide to manually register a component entity to your Backstage instance.  *You may find it helpful for future exercises to take note of the information that is provided alongside your components in the UI, and consider where it comes from.*

### Exercise 2: Write a Custom Plugin

Well, it's the end of the chapter and you probably saw this coming, but it's time to write your own custom plugin.

Checkout the Backstage docs on [creating a custom plugin](https://backstage.io/docs/plugins/create-a-plugin/) and develop a custom plugin. This plugin should live in its own repo and be imported into your Backstage instace. This can be a frontend or backend plugin (or both).
