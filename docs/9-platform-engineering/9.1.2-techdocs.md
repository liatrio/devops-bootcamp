      description: |
        This exercise instructs students to add the bare minimum amount of files needed for their Backstage instance to generate an MkDocs site and associate it with an entity in their Software Catalog.  Extra credit is offered for studying Backstage's ability to search within TechDocs stored in the Catalog -- the basic setup we point students towards in this exercise can lead to a search-related bug which is valuable for understanding the different ways Backstage can be configured to manage TechDocs.

# Backstage

Platform teams are responsible for managing an organization's IDP. As mentioned in the overview section this software can be an API, CLI, or GUI but needs to offer teams self-service tools that adhere to the companies best practices and standards.

In March 2020 Spotify open sourced their internal developer platform Backstage and donated the project to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Backstage is a web app that is designed to serve as a 'one stop shop' for all your developer needs. Through its key features of the Software Catalog, Templates, and TechDocs users can get a detailed overview of an organization's technology landscape, easily discover internal projects and documentation, and use a simplified process to create new projects that adhere to the company's standards.

### Exercise: Create a GitHub Organization

Backstage integrates heavily with SCM software as it is designed to be a 'single pane of glass' into an organization's development ecosystem. So to mimic that we will need
a GitHub org to play around with. Each person going through the bootcamp will need their own GitHub Organization.

1. Follow [GitHubs docs](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch) and create a new Organization (Free)



## Deliverables

- How might an enterprise organization make use of TechDocs to manage documentation?
