# Platform Engineering: An Overview

We have learned many of the tools and principles that have enabled DevOps teams to be self-sufficient. We have covered topics like infrastructure as code, continuous integration and continuous deployment, cloud computing, pipelines, and more. These tools have revolutionized the way we build and deploy software by breaking down the traditional silos of Dev and Ops teams and creating cross-functional self-sufficient teams.

These cross-functional teams are now responsible for all elements of their application, CI/CD, runtime, infrastructure, compliance, security etc. Furthermore, each cross-functional team at the organization has many of the same responsibilities and freedoms. The result of this free-for-all approach is a wide range of technologies and implementations all aimed at solving the same set of problems. Moreover, these teams are expected to have working knowledge and expertise in cloud infrastructure, CI/CD systems, application runtimes, compliance, monitoring, and security. All this complexity increases the cognitive load on the team, causes costly context switching, and contributes to a complex web of technologies across the organization. This lack of standardization and complexity can lead to a slow down in development, increased risk, and a poor developer experience. This is where Platform Engineering comes in.

## Platform Engineering

Platform Engineering solves the problem of sprawling complexity by developing an Internal Developer Platform (IDP). An IDP can be an API, CLI, or GUI that offers application teams self-service tools that adhere to the organization's standards and best practices, referred to as golden paths (or paved pathways). [According to the CNCF](https://tag-app-delivery.cncf.io/whitepapers/platforms/) golden paths are:

> _Templated compositions of well-integrated code and capabilities for rapid project development._

Simply put, these are templated well-designed common tasks in an organization. For example you could have a golden path that creates an Express API with pipelines, infra, tests, a Dockerfile, and Kubernetes manifests so that at a click of a button developers can be up and running with a "Hello World" application that integrates nicely into the organizations platform.

So maybe you are wondering if this is a step backwards? We used to have siloed teams (Dev and Ops). DevOps liberated teams by creating cross-functional teams that could pick the right tools for the job and owned their application ("you build it you run it"). Now Platform Engineering sounds like a return to a silo, no? If handled incorrectly this is a risk. At Liatrio we believe a Platform should be a joy to use. Platforms need to be treated like a product. The 'customers' of this product are internal users (developers). The platform should be designed with the users in mind, iteratively developed, prioritizing the most common use cases, and evolve with the organization's needs.

## DevOps Engineer vs Platform Engineer?

Searching the internet for 'Platform Engineer' can lead to a variety of inflammatory topics, none more so than "DevOps is dead Platform Engineering is here". Platform Engineering is the next step, an evolution of the DevOps movement but it does not replace a DevOps engineer on a cross-functional team. While the aim of a Platform team is to provide self-service tools that offload complexity and configuration from the cross-functional teams, the paved pathways in the IDP are just an onramp for teams. Think of the roles of a Platform team and the cross-functional team as 'admin' and 'user'. The Platform team is the 'admin' of the tools in an org -- they ensure that users of the platform have well configured tools that adhere to the companies' standards on security compliance and the such. The application team are the users, freed of the responsibility of the initial setup and configuration of the tools but still tasked with using the tools. Additionally since the paved pathways provide an onramp as the application matures, things like the CI/CD pipelines will evolve with the application's needs. So cross-functional teams still have a need for DevOps engineers but now the cognitive load is shared with the Platform team as they are users of the systems.

## Key Components of a Successful Internal Developer Platform (IdP)

Platforms need to be a joy to use, there will be no internal adoption (willingly) otherwise. That is why we believe that the following capabilities and characteristics are a must for platforms.

### Characteristics

Successful platforms providing the above capabilities must additionally maintain the following characteristics in order to be successfully adopted by customers:

- The Delivery Platform is a product focused on enabling teams to deliver value quickly
- The architecture and design of the platform is a living product and must be iteratively developed
- The platform team must leverage the platform to build the platform
- Teams have agency to update, improve, and change the platform collaboratively
- The platform must be built on best in class tools and highly Googleable, changing and adopting new technologies as business cases evolve
- Rapid and easy Break Glass access within minutes
- Landing zone capability that enables teams to start deploying on Day 1
- Cloud Native Modern Technologies and Tools
- Must provide a golden path, but let customers have agency to tread new ground
- Must transparently enable security
- Must enable out-of-the-box observability
- Must enable automated governance
- Must enable delivery to production to be calculated in minutes not hours
- Must follow modern delivery essentials
- Must support continued iteration
- Must support modern delivery practices
- Must enable immutable, versioned artifacts built once and run everywhere
- Must provide robust, simple, efficient, fast, and well trusted pipelines to deploy with an amazingly high probability of success
- Environment specific configuration must be decoupled from the build
- Scaling is automatic and just-in-time to ensure resiliency and up-time
- Performance must be baked in and not done as an afterthought
- Engineers must have the bandwidth to improve and go beyond just “getting it to work”
- Observability driven canary and blue green deployment models need to be easy to do increasing resiliency

## Conclusion

Platform Engineering is a natural evolution of DevOps principles, tailored to meet the demands of modern software development. By focusing on the creation of a shared, self-service platform, it addresses key challenges in complexity management, standardization, speed of delivery, and developer experience. A successful Internal Developer Platform incorporates essential components like self-service infrastructure, automated CI/CD, observability, security, and comprehensive developer resources, setting the stage for efficient and scalable software development practices.
