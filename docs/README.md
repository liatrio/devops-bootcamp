  # Liatrio's DevOps Bootcamp

</center>

## Introduction

Welcome! You must be here because you're interested in DevOps. Don't worry, we'll explain that right away! First, let's briefly go over some details.

"1.0" can be referred to as "Chapter One," while "1.2" can be referred to as "Chapter One, Section Two."

## Target Audience
This DevOps Bootcamp is used as an introduction to DevOps for Liatrio's apprentices. Therefore, there are deliverables at the end of each section that help guide the apprentices' training. However, anyone can go through the DevOps Bootcamp. Feel free to ignore the deliverables, etc. This bootcamp also assumes the bootcamper is using a Mac for the deliverables.

## Disclaimer
This bootcamp alone will by no means make anyone an expert on DevOps; that's where real, in-the-field experience engineering and shadowing come in. However, this bootcamp is a great start for anyone entering the world of DevOps! It is recommended that anyone going through this bootcamp have a mentor to fill in the gaps of information and answer questions, as well. Also, many of the exercises proposed in this bootcamp have no solution listed. This is because it is up to the bootcamper to come up with the solution without reading a guide. So, if you're wondering where a solution to an exercise is - there is likely none; that's up to you! There may be solutions posted in the future.

## Learning Goals
 1. Introduction to DevOps
 2. Virtual Machines and Containers
 3. Development Practices
 4. Release Management
 5. System Administration
 6. Cloud Computing
 7. Automation and Orchestration

## Expectations
 1. Share what you learn. Knowledge is best retained when you can teach it back yourself.
 2. If you're participating in the bootcamp with others, lift them up instead of speeding past them.
 3. Your learning should be in a demonstrable state at any given time.
 4. The turtle wins the race. If you don't fully understand something, speak up for help and spend more time on it.
 5. Be transparent in your progress.
 6. Have fun!
