# Managing Infrastructure

In this section, you will be learning how to deploy your golden image (and other artifacts) to a centralized location from your build pipeline.

## Nexus OSS

  [Nexus OSS](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/installation-and-upgrades) is a versioned artifact repository. It is used to store multiple versions of different packages and supports different repository types (Maven, npm, Docker, etc). It is scalable and integrates with lots of other software delivery tools.

## Maven

  **Maven** is a popular build tool for the Java ecosystem that you will come to learn about throughout the bootcamp. For now, you are not expected to have a firm grasp on what exactly it is, but you will revisit it along with the other build tools in Chapter 6. For now, all you need to understand is that Maven is a tool that can automate the building of code into executables called **artifacts**. This ties in with Nexus as that is an artifact *repository*.

## Delivery Pipeline

  Automated delivery pipelines accelerate software delivery and enable faster, safer deployments.
  An entire integrated toolchain is necessary to leverage the capabilities of an automated pipeline, orchestrated by a build server. Newly committed code that is pushed to the git server will trigger a webhook and cause the build servers to run certain tasks. General stages of a delivery pipeline include:

- Unit testing
- Code quality scanning
- Building artifacts (compiling, packaging, containerizing, etc)
- Publishing artifacts to an artifact repository
- Functional testing
- Deploying artifacts

## Exercise

Configure a self-hosted GitHub Action to deploy a build artifact to Nexus.

  1. Create another clone of your Golden Image
  2. Install [Nexus](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/installation-and-upgrades) into this clone
  3. In GitHub, fork the [spring-petclinic](https://github.com/liatrio/spring-petclinic) project.
  4. In the GitHub portal, add a new self-hosted runner to your fork.
  5. Create another clone of your Golden Image
  6. Set up this clone as your self-hosted runner in the GitHub portal
  7. Install any dependencies this image needs to be able to build the spring-petclinic project
  8. Alter the maven-build GitHub Action Workflow to use your self-hosted runner
  9. Add a `upload` step to your workflow that uploads the build output to your Nexus server.
  10. Commit your changes to the fork and verify that your workflow completed successfully.
  11. Verify that you see new artifacts have been uploaded on the Nexus server.

### Extra Credit

Working as a group, configure your `upload` step in your workflow to deploy to someone else's Nexus server using what you have learned about virtual networks.

?> If you are working on different networks you may need to use a tool like [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to bridge communication between your servers over the internet.
