# Local Development

An important use case for virtual machines is keeping parity between development and production environments. Developing and testing in an environment identical to the production environment helps reduce the, "but it works on my machine" type of problems that happen all too frequently when releasing software.

So far the tools we have looked at for building and running images are great for automation and managing complicated infrastructure. However, for developers that want to be able to easily create, use and share environments they are not very convenient. If only we could create and start a virtual machine with just two commands...

![developer image](img3/developer_light.svg ':size=150x150 :class=light-mode-icon :alt= developer image; light mode')
![developer image](img3/developer_dark.svg ':size=150x150 :class=dark-mode-icon :alt= developer image; dark mode')

## Vagrant

> Vagrant is a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments in a single workflow.

> _- [Introduction to Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/intro/index)_

Being able to create a Debian VM in two commands is pretty cool, but what if you want to customize your VM and share it with others? Imagine you're working with a team of developers and you want the entire team to be able to use a VM with the same libraries and tools installed.

You may have noticed some similarities between Packer and Vagrant. They both make use of a variety of virtualization platforms. They both have provisioners to configure machine images. This might not be surprising considering both tools are made by HashiCorp. To understand the differences between these tools it can be helpful to consider the problem they are trying to solve. Packer is primarily used to create machine images, often from scratch. Vagrant's use cases focus more on making machine images easier to use and manage. Another way to understand the relationship between these tools is knowing that many of the official Vagrant Base Boxes are actually created using Packer.

## Exercise

In this exercise we will create a Vagrant Base Box using our Packer template, upload our base box to VagrantCloud and then write a Vagrant file that starts your base box.

Read [Creating a Base Box](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/boxes/base) and [Creating a (VMWare) Base Box](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/docs/providers/vmware/boxes).

1. Modify your Packer build file to meet Vagrant's Base Box requirements.
    - allow the `vagrant` user to have password-less sudo
    - `UseDNS no` (optional)
    - update the CentOS packages and kernel
    - install Vagrant [insecure key pair](https://github.com/hashicorp/vagrant/tree/master/keys) for `vagrant` user
    - install Guest Additions

    ?> Many of Vagrant requirements are already taken care of for you in the example. It is up to you to figure out which one(s) you need to add

2. Add a [Vagrant `post-processor`](https://www.packer.io/docs/post-processors/vagrant/vagrant) to your Packer build template. Configure it to output both a VMWare Fusion image and a Vagrant box.

3. Create a VagrantCloud account if needed and upload your box.

4. Read and install required pieces for the [Vagrant VMWare provider](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/docs/providers/vmware)

5. Create a Vagrant file that will pull your base box from VagrantCloud

6. Run `vagrant up` and verify Vagrant can pull and start your VM.

7. Verify that `vagrant ssh` will ssh into your VM.
