# Virtual Machines

The evolution of the computing industry led to a paradigm shift with the advent of virtual machines (VMs). In the early days of computing, applications were tied to specific physical machines, which led to hardware underutilization, system downtime during maintenance, and scalability issues. Virtual machines emerged as a revolutionary solution, enabling multiple operating systems and applications to run simultaneously on a single physical server.

Virtual machines simulate a physical computer's hardware and system resources, creating a virtual compute system. They essentially decouple the software from the underlying hardware, thereby resolving many of the problems faced in the industry. By doing so, VMs greatly improve hardware utilization as multiple VMs can run on a single server, each with its own operating system and applications. Moreover, they enhance system availability and reliability since applications on a VM can be moved, copied, or backed up more easily than on a physical machine.

# Hypervisors

The concept of a hypervisor is closely tied to that of virtual machines. A hypervisor, also known as a Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM), is a layer of software, firmware, or hardware that creates, runs, and manages virtual machines. It stands as an interface between the physical host machine and the virtual environments (VMs), allocating resources such as processing power, memory, and storage from the host to the VMs.

There are two types of hypervisors. Type 1, or bare-metal hypervisors, run directly on the host's hardware, and examples include VMware's ESXi, Microsoft's Hyper-V, and the open-source Xen. Type 2, or hosted hypervisors, run on the operating system of the host machine, with examples including Oracle's VirtualBox and VMware's Workstation. Hypervisors play a crucial role in maintaining isolation between VMs, ensuring that problems in one VM do not affect others, thereby promoting security and stability in a virtualized environment.

# Golden Images

**Golden Images** (also called base images or image templates) are machine images with pre-configured operating systems. They typically include specialized configurations, security patches and common libraries and tools. Once a Golden Image is created it can be used to easily and reliably create identical environments on different hardware or virtual machines.

![linux image](img3/linux_dark.svg ':size=100x100 :class=dark-mode-icon :alt= linux image; dark mode')

## Exercise 1: Manual Build

For this exercise, you will create a Golden Image by manually installing and configuring Debian in VMWare Fusion.

1. Create a free VMWare Customer Connect account and get the free [Personal Use License](https://customerconnect.vmware.com/en/evalcenter?p=fusion-player-personal-13)
2. Download and install VMWare Fusion and register with your Personal Use License
3. [Download Debian DVD iso](https://www.debian.org/releases/bullseye/debian-installer/), for your machines architecture
4. Using VMWare Fusion create a new virtual machine and install Debian using the image you downloaded.

  ?> Use `Install` vs the `Graphical Install` option. And when you are presented the opportunity `Choose software to install:` only select `SSH Server` and `standard system utilities`. Hint spacebar will select an option not Enter

![debian software options](img3/debian-install.png ':class=img-center :alt= debian software options')

5. On the host (local machine) generate an ed25519 encrypted SSH key. Add the public key to the guest's (VM) `authorized_keys` file.
6. Confirm you can SSH from your host to the guest with the private ed25519 key you generated.

  ?> To SSH to your guest you may need to change the network type in VMWare Fusion. There are several different [network types](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/1022264) that VMWare Fusion supports. Read about and experiment with a few types. Discuss the use cases for each type.

7. Update Debian to have the latest packages
8. Create a snapshot of your updated machine and name it 'Golden Image'
9. Add some files to the home directory.
10. Revert back to the snapshot named 'Golden Image'. And take note of what happened to the files you added in step 9

## Immutable Infrastructure

Golden images can be a critical part of a very important strategy for managing software environments known as **Immutable Infrastructure**. We will cover Immutable Infrastructure in more depth throughout the DevOps Bootcamp. For now, watch this video of HashiCorp co-founder and CTO Armon Dadgar explaining [What is Mutable vs. Immutable Infrastructure](https://www.hashicorp.com/resources/what-is-mutable-vs-immutable-infrastructure/).

## Packer

You should now be familiar with the process for creating a Golden Image with VMWare Fusion. Imagine that security updates needed to be kept up to date in the Golden Image. You could repeat the steps from the first exercise to manually create a new image, but doing so every time a security patch is released could be time consuming and error prone.

This kind of repetitive work is often referred to as toil. Reducing toil from various roles in software delivery (developers, operations, SRE, etc) through automation is an important part of DevOps transformations.

> **Toil** is the kind of work tied to running a production service that tends to be manual, repetitive, automatable, tactical, devoid of enduring value, and that scales linearly as a service grows.

![packer image](img3/packer_light.svg ':size=350x350 :class=light-mode-icon :alt= packer image; light mode')
![packer image](img3/packer_dark.svg ':size=350x350 :class=dark-mode-icon :alt= packer image; light mode')

> **Packer** is an open source tool for creating identical machine images for multiple platforms from a single source configuration.
>
> *- [Introduction to Packer](https://www.packer.io/intro)*

Since Packer defines everything needed to create an image in configuration files it can be run without manual intervention and is ideal for automation. It also makes it more convenient to maintain and update images over time. Packer has a variety of other features and use cases.

- Continuous Delivery
  - Lightweight, portable, and command-line driven.
  - New images can be launched and tested, verifying that the infrastructure changes work.
- Dev/Prod Parity
  - Keeps development, staging, and production as similar as possible.
  - Can be used to generate images for multiple platforms.
- Configuration as code
  - Image changes can be maintained and tracked using version control.
- Appliance/Demo Creation
  - Automatically create appliances with software preinstalled.

## Exercise 2: Automated Build

In this exercise, you will use Packer to create a Golden Image with the same configuration as the one you created in the first exercise.

1. [Install Packer](https://learn.hashicorp.com/packer/getting-started/install) on your machine.

2. Fork the [packer-plugin-vmware repo](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer-plugin-vmware/tree/v1.0.8), and checkout tag `v1.0.8`

3. Read [Provisioning in Packer](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/tutorials/docker-get-started/docker-get-started-provision) then modify `examples/build.pkr.hcl` such that your build artifact will be the same as the VM you configured in Exercise 1.
    - Update packages
    - Add your public SSH key to the `authorized_keys`

  ?> Depending on your machines architecture you may need to make some changes to `build.pkr.hcl`

  ?> The `boot_command` is very unique to the OS version and machine architecture. Please reference [Debian preseed](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/guides/automatic-operating-system-installs/preseed_ubuntu) for general information on unattended Debian installs. And for more functional examples see [Chef's Bento repo](https://github.com/chef/bento/tree/v202302.22.0/packer_templates)

4. Build your new [Golden Image with Packer](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer-plugin-vmware/tree/v1.0.8/example#running-vmware-fusion-examples)

5. In VMWare fusion start the Golden Image created via Packer and verify
    - You can SSH with your private ed25519 key
