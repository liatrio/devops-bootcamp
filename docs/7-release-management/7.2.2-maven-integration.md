# Maven Releases

Let's bring this all together and think about the process of releasing software.

Imagine PetClinic, Joda-Time, and Junit being maintained by 2 different teams working towards the same production release date.

One thing that is very important in software delivery is to know the exact version of all artifacts being released.

Everything that will be released (including dependencies) must be release versions, not [SNAPSHOT](https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/index.html#what-is-a-snapshot-version)'s.

Here are two ways of doing this.

- Using the [Maven release plugin](http://maven.apache.org/maven-release/maven-release-plugin/) with Maven CLI.
- Using the [Third-Party Maven release GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/java-maven-release) to release artifacts as part of the GitHub workflow.

## Exercise - Maven Deploy to Nexus

This section is designed to give you an introduction into how Maven interacts with Nexus and how to use Maven in GitHub Actions.

## Tips

Use containerization for the following exercise, see [examples](https://github.com/liatrio/devops-bootcamp/tree/master/examples/ch7/Dev-Containers).

1. Fork the following repos:
   - [spring-petclinic](https://github.com/liatrio/spring-petclinic)
   - [joda-time](https://github.com/JodaOrg/joda-time)
2. Update the `spring-petclinic`'s pom.xml to have a dependency defined for `joda-time` and build `spring-petclinic` to confirm it works
   - You can find the latest version of `joda-time` from [Maven Central repository here](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/joda-time/joda-time) (*if you click on the version, Maven will even generate the pom.xml code needed*)
2. Setup your local Nexus for storing artifacts for both repositories.
3. Using Maven CLI, build and deploy the both projects to Nexus.
    - Make sure to update the pom.xml to define the [distribution management](https://maven.apache.org/pom.html#repository) snapshot and release repository definitions to use your local Nexus repository paths.
    - Make sure to update your [settings.xml](https://maven.apache.org/settings.html#servers) with authentication for your Nexus repositories.
    - Take note of which Nexus repository the artifact was deployed to.
4. Update both projects to release versions (if they aren't already).
5. Validate the deployments to the Nexus Releases repository worked.
6. Attempt to deploy that same release version again.
    - Take note of what happened in this attempt.
7. Bump up the `joda-time` dependency version in the `spring-petclinic` pom.xml to a version that is higher than the latest available in the central repository (*we expect to fail the build doing this*).
8. Bump up the release version of the `joda-time` repo so it matches the version `spring-petclinic` is now dependent on. Deploy this release to your local Nexus.
9. Try building `spring-petclinic` again.
   - Did this fix the build? Why not?
   - Take note of why `spring-petclinic` cannot find that version of `joda-time`.
10. **`Challenge:`** Fix `spring-petclinic` so it pulls the `joda-time` dependency at the bumped up version from your local Nexus repo.

## Exercise - Maven in GitHub Actions

1. Create a GitHub Actions workflow to build and deploy artifacts to Nexus on commits to the remote repository.
    - Make sure to expose local Nexus with ngrok so GitHub runners can reach it.
    - A good starting point is GitHub's [Publish Java packages with Maven](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/publishing-packages/publishing-java-packages-with-maven)
    - You can also try to accomplish this with the GitHub Action [Java Maven release](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/java-maven-release)
2. **`Challenge:`** [Create GitHub Action jobs](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-action-build-chain-cross-repo-builds) to build dependent artifacts when the artifacts they depend on are built successfully. (*on successful artifact build of joda-time, the spring-petclinic should get built as well*)

## Tips

- Make sure you are adding the necessary plugin defnitions to the pom.xml for the Maven goals you are trying to execute.
- What does the ID in the Distribution Management section align with?
- Have you created a release version twice?
- Don't rush. Think about what is going on behind the scenes.

# Deliverable

Discuss what a release is and how releases can be performed.

Discuss the benefits of plugins such as buildnumber and the benefits of Nexus Maven repo settings for version control of artifacts.

Discuss with your group any difficulties you ran into, what worked well, and show off your completed deployment setup.
