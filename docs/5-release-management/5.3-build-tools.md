# Build Tools

Build tools play an important part in software releases. Aside from building the actual application they can be leveraged to automate other tasks to get the product to a releasable state such as running tests, packaging the application into an artifact, deploying artifacts to a repository, etc.

In this section we will focus on how different tools can be leveraged to automate tasks to release an application. Keep in mind there are lots of other build tools with similar features. Also, keep an eye out for the limitations of various build tools. We will be looking at other approaches later in this chapter.
