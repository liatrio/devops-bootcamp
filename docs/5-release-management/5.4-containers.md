# Containers

Containers are a fundamentally different way of packaging and managing applications compared to traditional artifacts like Java or NPM packages. Since each container has its own runtime environment they can be easier to deploy, scale and update. This allows for changes in how applications are designed and run. It also introduce new challenges for security, networking, monitoring and managing cpu, memory and storage resources. It also means new tools for software delivery.

In this section we will look at some solutions for how docker images are distributed and use Helm to manage resources in a Kubernetes cluster.
