Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes. Helm packages are called charts, which are collections of files that describe Kubernetes resources. Helm Charts are used to manage installing, and upgrading complex Kubernetes applications. 

Helm charts are composed of Kubernetes resource templates and metadata used to render the templates and create the resource in a Kubernetes cluster. We can create Helm charts by writing resource templates and metadata as YAML files. The required files that Helm will work with are `values.yaml` and `Chart.yaml`. The chart.yaml define the general description of the chart and the values.yaml define the values that are used in the templates. The Helm chart contains a `/templates` folder with Kubernetes resource definitions. Helm will iterate through these definition files and apply them to the Kubernetes cluster. 

Review the [chart template developers guide](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/#the-chart-template-developers-guide) for more information on creating Helm charts.

## Exercise 1

In this exercise we will get started by installing Helm and creating, installing and updating a basic chart with a ConfigMap Kubernetes resource.

1. [Install Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

2. Create a new Helm chart following this [chart file structure](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/) and add the required fields to the `Chart.yaml`.

?> Do not use `helm create` for this exercise.

3.  Add a `configmap.yaml` file to the templates folder and define a ConfigMap Kubernetes resource with some data.

?> Review the [Kubernetes ConfigMaps docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/) to find a description and example of ConfigMap resources

4. Run `helm lint .` to check the syntax of your helm chart.

5. Run `helm install configmap .` to install the Helm chart and create the configmap resource to the Kubernetes cluster. 

?> To view the state of the Helm chart you just installed you can run `helm list -a` 

6. Run `kubectl get configmap NAME -o yaml` to see the yaml that is applied from the Helm install step. Also use `kubectl describe` to view the configmap and compare the results.

7. Run `helm template .` to show the entire output that Helm is creating for you.

8. Add a key with a string value to `values.yaml`. Update `configmap.yaml` to use that value as a value in the ConfigMap data.

?> Review the [Values Files](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/values_files/) section of the Chart Template Guide for additional information.

9. Run `helm upgrade NAME .` to apply the changes.

10. Use `helm` and `kubectl` to verify your changes.

## Exercise 2

In this exercise we will take an existing Helm chart which deploys the [RealWorld demo application](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) backend and add a chart dependency to also install MongoDB for the backend to use.

1. If you haven't already, clone the DevOps Bootcamp git repo on your local machine. This exercise will build off of the Helm chart in the `examples/ch4/helm/RealWorld` folder.

2. Modify the `values.yaml` to pull the RealWorld backend image that you pushed to Dockerhub from the previous section. 

?> How is the backend image value set in `values.yaml` used in the charts templates?

3. Install the Helm Chart and use `kubectl` to verify the Pod created by the Helm chart is using your RealWorld backend image and check the status of the Pod. 

?> You can use `kubectl logs` to view the pod logs. You should see an error generated by the backend service because it cannot connect to a MongoDB server. 

?> After a few failed attempts to run the container the Pods status will change to _Crash Loop Backoff_ and it will wait for an increased amount of time before trying to run the container again.

4. Add the official [MongoDB Helm Chart](https://bitnami.com/stack/mongodb/helm) as a dependency for our RealWorld Helm Chart.

?> Review the Helm chart documentation [Chart Dependencies](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#chart-dependencies/) and [Dependency command](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_dependency/) sections for more information

?> Make sure to run `helm dependencies update` to download the mongoDB helm chart

5. Add configuration for the MongoDB subchart to the `values.yaml` file. 

?> Make sure to review the [MongoDB Helm Chart documentation](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/mongodb) to configure the correct MongoDB authentication parameters.

6. Update the container environment variables defined in `deployment-backend.yaml` to configure the RealWorld backend application to connect to the MongoDB service.

?> The MONGODB_URI environment variable will need to point to the MongoDB Kubernetes service name and include the username and password you configured with the MongoDB subchart parameters. 

7. Run `helm dependencies update` to download the dependencies.

8. Apply the Helm chart changes with `helm upgrade` to install the MongoDB dependency. Use `helm` and `kubectl` commands to check the status of the Helm chart and application.

## Exercise 3

In this exercise we will add a Kubernetes deployment and service to our Helm chart to deploy the RealWorld demo frontend application.

1. Change the API_ROOT constant located in the `agent.js` file for the frontend project to reference `localhost`. 

?> In real networked environment it wouldn't make any sense to configure the application this way but it is necessary to demonstrate the application frontend communicating with the backend on our local environment.

2. Rebuild the Docker image and then push the new image to Dockerhub. 

3. Add `deployment-frontend.yaml` and `service-frontend.yaml` files to the templates folder and create a frontend deployment and service based on the existing backend deployment and service. Add values to `values.yaml` to configure your front deployment and service.

4. Run `helm upgrade NAME . ` to apply the Helm chart changes and add the new frontend resources to Kubernetes.

5. Port forward the frontend and backend service ports to your local machine.

?> The notes output when you ran `helm install` should have some useful hints :)

6. Open the frontend application in a web browser and verify it is communicating with the backend service.

## Exercise 4

In this exercise we will create another Helm chart using the [Helm Create](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_create/) command and configure it to deploy a Jenkins instance.

1. Create a new helm chart with `helm create`. Once you have created a helm chart, it will contain a templates folder, a charts folder, a values.yaml, and a chart.yaml. 

2. Modify the values.yaml file to reference the Jenkins Docker image you created in chapter 2. 

3. Change the container port to the port needed for our jenkins instance and also make sure that the app version is matching the tag of your instance as well.

4. Use the command `helm install` to install the chart you have configured.

?> Helm install has a --dry-run option which will output the potential configuration without deploying. Run this to see if your configuration is how you want it.

5. Use kubectl to look at the current pods which should contain the configured jenkins pod.
