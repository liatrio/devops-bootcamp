# Installations

Linux packages are compressed file archives that contain all of the necessary code for a particular application or service relative to your system.

A DevOps Engineer & Consultant should be very familiar with the quickest ways to obtain software and which situations certain installation methods are suited for.

## Optional Practice
If you are new to the terminal, feel free to run `vimtutor` and complete the exercise. 

## Package Managers
 Linux distros use different package managers to search, install and maintain software.

 - REHL based distros, such as CentOS, use `yum`.
 - Debian based distros, such as Ubuntu use `apt`.
 - Arch uses `pacman`.
 - Alpine uses `apk`.
 - Macs can make use of [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

## Finding Packages
If you know you need a package, but you aren't sure what the name is exactly, you can search for  the package. If you wanted to look for a package titled ‘openjdk’, for example, you might use one of the following three commands.

```
apt-cache search openjdk
yum search openjdk
brew search openjdk
```

## Installing Packages
Once you know the package name you can install it along with its dependencies using the package manager.

```
apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel
brew cask install adoptopenjdk
```

## Unavailable Package
Sometimes a package is not available from the central yum/apt repository. In that case, you may need add the repository. If this is an option, the repository url will be available from the repository owner.

The steps are generally...
 1. Download the repository key (wget, curl).
 2. Update your package list.
 3. Install the package.
 4. In yum, this is often done in the etc/yum.repos.d file. With apt-get, this is done with the update.

## Manage Installed Packages
Package managers also let you manage installed packages by searching for and installing updates

### Check for updates
```
apt-get update

yum check-update

brew update
brew outdated
```

### Install updates
```
apt-get upgrade
yum update
brew upgrade
```

## Security
The official package repositories for major distros receive a lot of scrutiny and can generally be trusted to not contain malicious or dangerous software. Unofficial repositories often have less oversight and should be considered less secure. It is not uncommon for production environments to be restricted to packages from enterprise distro repositories or internal package repositories which have gone through additional vetting. It is best practice to always consider how trustworthy the source of a software package is before installing it in any environment and to be extra cautious when introducing software to critical systems.

# Deliverable

Install what software you think you need on your Mac using Homebrew. Once that is complete, research `brew leaves` and discuss your conclusions.
