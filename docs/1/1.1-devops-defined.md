  Let's see what the experts have to say.

>"DevOps (a portmanteau of software development and server operations) represents the integration between software development and operations engineering that has become increasingly necessary with the emergence of cloud computing. In essence, the jobs are no longer mutually exclusive- developers need more operations-based knowledge in order to understand how their application will be deployed, test locally and preemptively address potential security risks, while systems administrators need to know developer-based materials in order to design infrastructure optimally to fit an application’s needs without wasting capacity and to troubleshoot issues with the increasingly complex software cycle. Additionally, site reliability engineering and many modern security roles require a background with a balance between development and operations." \- [OSU DevOps Bootcamp](https://devopsbootcamp.osuosl.org/whatisdevops.html)

>"A cultural and professional movement, focused on how we build and operate high velocity organizations, born from the experiences of its practitioners." \- [chef/devops-kungfu](https://github.com/chef/devops-kungfu/blob/master/README.md#what-is-devops)

>"The term “DevOps” typically refers to the emerging professional movement
that advocates a collaborative working relationship between Development
and IT Operations, resulting in the fast flow of planned work (i.e., high
deploy rates), while simultaneously increasing the reliability, stability,
resilience and security of the production environment." \- [Gene Kim](http://www.itrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/11things.pdf)

## Effectiveness over Efficiency
In order to build and operate the kinds of complex, distributed software systems required for 2018 and beyond, we need to [emphasize effectiveness over efficiency](http://labs.openviewpartners.com/results-driven-leadership-decision-making/) for technical teams. Delivering changes rapidly, reliably, and repeatedly is not possible if we aim to minimize ‘costs’ at specific points of the value chain, as this kind of efficiency usually ends up causing unnecessary constraints. Instead, we should focus on flow and completion of work in progress. Change Request tickets should not sit in a queue for days, we should not separate ‘testing’ as something that happens only ‘after development’, and changes should not sit waiting weeks and weeks for the Staging or Pre-Production environment to be available.

## [The Three Ways](http://itrevolution.com/the-three-ways-principles-underpinning-devops/)

 1. Culture of Continuous Experimentation and Learning

 Recognizing failure is important data about how and where to improve.

 2. Amplifying Feedback Loops

 Cut the time between action and reaction, failure and success.

 3. Systems Thinking

 Learn how everything is interconnected, from concept to customer.

## [CAMS](https://www.chef.io/blog/2010/07/16/what-devops-means-to-me/)

 1. Culture

 It’s about how people relate and work, which is not something you can buy.

 2. Automation

 Faster, less error-prone processes help amplify feedback loops.

 3. Measurement

 You can’t get where you want to be until you know where you are.

 4. Sharing

 Effective teamwork ignores organizational boundaries.

## [ICE](http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/01/devops-keeps-it-cool-with-ice.html)

 1. Inclusivity

 Everyone is responsible for (and benefits from) these practices.

 2. Complex Systems

 Iteration is imperative to maintain a grasp on complexity.

 3. Empathy

 Real collaboration requires real understanding of another’s point of view.

Describe DevOps in your own words with your peers.
