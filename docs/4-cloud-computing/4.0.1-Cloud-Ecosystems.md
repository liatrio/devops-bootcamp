# 4.0.1 Cloud Service Ecosystems

![cloud service image](./img4/cloudservices.png ':alt= goal image; light mode')

There are many different types of cloud service ecosystems all delivering varying levels of management for applications, data and
their underlying infrastructure. They are as follows:

## Self-Managed

Usually called on-prem or on-site, Self-Managed simply means everything -- hardware, networking, apps and data are all managed by the consumer either on-prem or co-located.
This typically involves self-managed hardware in racks in a datacenter with limited virtualization of resources. Self-Managed isn't exactly a cloud service offering, but is included here to illustrate the increasing levels of management.

## IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service

Infrastructure-as-a-service, or IaaS, is a step away from on-premises infrastructure.
It’s a pay-as-you-go service where a third party provides you with infrastructure services, like storage and
virtualization, as you need them, via a cloud, through the internet.

As the consumer, you are responsible for the operating system, runtimes, data, and applications;
a provider gives you access to, and management of, the network, servers, hardware virtualization,
and storage you need.

This eliminates the need to maintain your own datacenter. Instead, you access and control the infrastructure
via a command line interface (CLI) or web dashboard.

IaaS gives you flexibility to purchase only the components you need and scale them up or down as needed.
There’s low overhead and maintenance costs, making IaaS a very affordable option.

Examples of IaaS are AWS EC2, Google CE, and Azure VM.

## CaaS - Container as a Service

Container-as-a-service is a cloud service that offers container-based virtual computing to users, some refer
to CaaS as a subset of IaaS. CaaS service providers offer their clients a full-fledged framework where they
can perform deployment and management of applications, clusters, and containers.
Without CaaS, software development teams need to deploy, manage, and monitor the underlying
infrastructure that containers run on.

The CaaS model was created to let developers create, execute, and manage applications that are container-based.
A CaaS model is signified by the service provider offering clusters and containers and services.

CaaS enables development teams to think at the higher order container level instead of
dealing with all the lower-level infrastructure management.

Examples of CaaS are AWS ECS, Azure AKS, and Docker Cloud

## PaaS - Platform as a Service

Platform-as-a-service is another step further from full, on-premise infrastructure management.
A provider hosts the hardware and software on its own infrastructure and delivers this platform
to the user as an integrated solution, solution stack, or service through an internet connection.

Primarily useful for developers and programmers, PaaS allows the user to develop,
run, and manage their own apps without having to build and maintain the
infrastructure or platform usually associated with the process. External resources, such as
databases, and queues are configured and attached to runtime containers by the platform.
Developers can use built-in provisioned resources to create their applications.

The consumer writes, builds, and manages their apps, but they do it without the headaches of
software updates, hardware maintenance or containerization. The consumer pushes an uncontainerized
application and the platform figures out how to deploy.

A few examples of PaaS are AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku, Cloudfoundry, Azure Spring Apps, Red Hat OpenShift, and GitHub Codespaces.

## FaaS - Function as a Service

Function-as-a-service is much like PaaS in that the platform provides virtualized resources
to run single-purpose serverless functions. Depending on the provider, a FaaS solution
may require containerization prior to deployment. Generally, FaaS deployments do not have
running instances unless they are currently being used. As such, FaaS is good cost-savings
strategy for functionality that is rarely used, or has big fluctuations in load.

An example of FaaS is AWS Lambda.

## SAAS - Software as a Service

Software-as-a-service is cloud-hosted, ready-to-use application software.
Consumers pay a monthly or annual fee to use a complete application from within a web browser,
desktop client or mobile app. The application and all of the infrastructure required to
deliver it - servers, storage, networking, middleware, application software, data storage

- are hosted and managed by the SAAS vendor.

The vendor manages all upgrades and patches to the software, usually invisibly to customers.
Typically, the vendor ensures a level of availability, performance and security as part of
a service level agreement (SLA). Consumers can add more users and data storage on demand
at additional cost.

Examples of SAAS are Microsoft 365, Salesforce, Slack, DocuSign, and Miro
