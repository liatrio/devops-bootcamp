# S3 & CloudFront

In this section we will run through several exercises which showcase AWS S3 and CloudFront. Each exercise builds on the previous so make sure you understand each step before moving onto the next. You'll start with IaaS solutions and move on to some CaaS services.

## Exercise 1: Create a Website using an S3 bucket

> Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is the largest and most performant, secure, and feature-rich object storage service. With Amazon S3, organizations of all sizes and industries can store any amount of data for any use case, including applications, IoT, data lakes, analytics, backup and restore, archive, and disaster recovery. -- [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)

For this exercise we're hosting a static HTML website using AWS S3. We will be using a simple react based application called [S3 Realworld UI DOB](https://github.com/liatrio/s3-realworld-ui-dob) to create our sample website. Feel free to try creating and substituting with a different template or project.

**Requirements**

- You will need to have npm installed to perform this exercise.

1. Clone the sample project.
2. Navigate to the project directory. Run `npm install` to fetch all project dependencies.
3. Generate the HTML for the templates with `npm run build`
4. Run `npm start` and open <http://localhost:3000> to confirm that the website is set up correctly.
5. Create the S3 Bucket. Replace *YOUR_NAME* with your name and *PROFILE_NAME* with the name of the AWS cli profile you set up. Make sure to replace *PROFILE_REGION* with the region you configured your AWS cli profile to talk to (run `cat ~/.aws/config` to see what your cli is configured to).

```bash
aws-vault exec PROFILE_NAME -- aws s3api create-bucket --bucket YOUR_NAME-dob-react --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=PROFILE_REGION.
```

6. Verify that the S3 bucket was created in the AWS console.
7. Configure the Bucket for Static Website Hosting. This command specifies the bucket as one that hosts static website content as well as specifies which files to be used for the home page and error page. Don't forget to change the *YOUR_NAME* and *PROFILE_NAME* values.

```bash
aws-vault exec PROFILE_NAME -- aws s3 website s3://YOUR_NAME-dob-react --index-document index.html --error-document 404.html
```

8. Add tags to the S3 Bucket. While tagging resources is an optional feature in AWS, it is an important organization habit to get into.

```bash
aws-vault exec PROFILE_NAME -- aws s3api put-bucket-tagging --bucket YOUR_NAME-dob-react --tagging 'TagSet=[{Key=Client,Value=Internal},{Key=Project,Value=DOB},{Key=Environment,Value=Demo},{Key=Application,Value=React},{Key=Owner,Value=YOUR_NAME}]'
```

9. Verify the tags were created in the AWS console.
10. Upload the contents of the *build/* folder, which contains the HTML generated from the template, to our S3 bucket.

```bash
aws-vault exec PROFILE_NAME -- aws s3 sync build/ s3://YOUR_NAME-dob-react
```

11. Before your website will be visible to the outside world you need to allow outside traffic to access your bucket. AWS manages access control to S3 buckets via [Bucket Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucket-policies.html). Read about bucket policies and add a policy to allow public read access.

12. Navigate to your buckets public DNS name to confirm that all steps were followed properly (Look for a section called **Static website hosting** on your S3 bucket **Properties** tab).

## Exercise 2: Create a Web Distribution for your S3 Website using CloudFront

> Amazon CloudFront is a web service that speeds up distribution of your static and dynamic web content, for example, .html, .css, .php, image, and media files, to end users. CloudFront delivers your content through a worldwide network of edge locations. When an end user requests content that you're serving with CloudFront, the user is routed to the edge location that provides the lowest latency, so content is delivered with the best possible performance. If the content is already in that edge location, CloudFront delivers it immediately. If the content is not currently in that edge location, CloudFront retrieves it from an Amazon S3 bucket or an HTTP server (for example, a web server) that you have identified as the source for the definitive version of your content.
> --- [AWS Docs on CloudFront](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/index.html#lang/en_us)

This exercise will enable a Web Distribution using CloudFront for the S3 website we just
deployed, and create an alias Record Set to forward traffic from a subdomain using liatr.io.

1. Create the CloudFront Distribution. This command specifies what URL and root object to use as the origin for the web distribution. Then take note of the created distribution's ARN, Domain Name, ID, and ETag that the command outputs. The ARN can be used to add tags, the domain name is where you can reach your distribution on the web, and the ID and ETag are used to delete the distribution.

```bash
aws-vault exec PROFILE_NAME -- aws cloudfront create-distribution --origin-domain-name YOUR_NAME-dob-react.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com --default-root-object index.html
```

2. Navigate to the outputted CloudFront Domain Name to view your S3 content now distributed using a Web Distribution. This enables your S3 content to be accessible as fast as possible for users.
3. Tag your Distribution using the ARN from the output of step 1.

```bash
aws-vault exec PROFILE_NAME -- aws cloudfront tag-resource --resource ARN --tags 'Items=[{Key=Client,Value=Internal},{Key=Project,Value=DOB},{Key=Environment,Value=Demo},{Key=Application,Value=React},{Key=Owner,Value=YOUR_NAME}]'
```

4. Verify the tags are added to your Distribution in the AWS console.

## Cleanup

The following commands delete all objects in the bucket, remove the bucket and delete the distribution.

**These commands are dangerous! Make sure you actually want to delete, and double-check your syntax.**

1. Remove all Objects from the S3 Bucket.

```bash
aws-vault exec PROFILE_NAME -- aws s3 rm s3://YOUR_NAME-dob-react --recursive
```

2. Delete the empty S3 Bucket.

```bash
aws-vault exec PROFILE_NAME -- aws s3api delete-bucket --bucket YOUR_NAME-dob-react
```

3. Get the configuration for the distribution, using its ID from the command earlier, and save it to a file.

```bash
aws-vault exec PROFILE_NAME -- aws cloudfront get-distribution-config --id ID > distribution-config
```

4. Edit the `distribution-config` file so that it only contains the contents of the *DistributionConfig* field and change `Enabled` to false.
5. Disable the distribution and record the ETag from the output.

```bash
aws-vault exec PROFILE_NAME -- aws cloudfront update-distribution --id ID --if-match ETAG --distribution-config file://distribution-config
```

6. The distribution can not be deleted until each of the edge locations have been disabled. Check for the status `Deployed`:

```bash
aws-vault exec PROFILE_NAME -- aws cloudfront get-distribution --id ID
```

7. Delete the Distribution using its ID and the ETag from the update-distribution command.

```bash
aws-vault exec PROFILE_NAME -- aws cloudfront delete-distribution --id ID --if-match ETAG
```
