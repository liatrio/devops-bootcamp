# Building AMI Images with Packer

![packer plus aws image](img4/packer+aws.svg  ':size=400px :class=img-center :alt= packer plus aws image')

In this section, we will be going deeper into the functionality of Packer. If you are hazy on how to use Packer review Chapter 2. We will be using Packer to create a Linux AMI image on AWS provision it and create an auto scaling group using the new AMI.

> An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) provides the information required to launch an instance. You must specify an AMI when you launch an instance. You can launch multiple instances from a single AMI when you need multiple instances with the same configuration. You can use different AMIs to launch instances when you need instances with different configurations. [Amazon Machine Images](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html)

## Exercise - Creating a custom AMI

1. Make sure you have Packer installed on your local machine.
2. Follow the Packer [Build an Image](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/tutorials/aws-get-started) instructions to build a simple AMI and setup some basic provisioning.
3. Remove the AMIs you created using the AWS CLI.
4. Adapt the User Data script you wrote in the last section to run as a [Shell Provisioner](https://www.packer.io/docs/provisioners/shell.html) and create an AMI.
5. Research the `aws ec2 create-launch-template` command and use it to create a Launch Template using your new AMI. Don't forget to correctly name and tag your Launch Template.
6. Use the `aws autoscaling create-auto-scaling-group` command to create an Auto Scaling Group using the new Launch Template.

## Deliverables

- Discuss some advantages of creating a custom AMI instead of using User Data to provision an EC2 instance.
- Discuss the tradeoffs of including your application in your AMI.
- Discuss some other use cases for using other Packer provisioners to create AWS AMIs.
