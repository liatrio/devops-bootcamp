# Auto Scaling

This section demonstrates use cases for several AWS tools to provide performance scaling and high availability.

**Section Goals**

- Deploy and provision EC2 instances with User Data.
- Manually create a Load Balancer for EC2 instances.
- Create a Launch Configuration to automate creating EC2 instances.
- Create an Auto Scaling Group to manage availability of a service.

## About User Data

EC2 instances can be configured using the User Data option which runs commands when a new instance is launched. User Data can accomplish anything that shell commands can. You can think of it at being similar to the shell provisioner in Vagrant. User Data can be specified when launching an EC2 instance via the AWS Console or via the AWS CLI by utilizing the --user-data flag.

Read more about User Data in the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html#instancedata-add-user-data).

## Exercise 1 - Create EC2 instance with User Data

In this exercise we will create an EC2 instance and use a User Data script to provision the instance as host for a Java web application. We recommend configuring a machine to run [Spring's PetClinic Project](https://github.com/liatrio/spring-petclinic) on Amazon Linux 2023. But you are free to do this exercise with another web application and distro.

1. Create a script to pass into `--user-data`. In general the script needs to:
    - Install all dependencies for your web application
    - Start your web application

2. Create a security group to expose your webapp (port 8080 for PetClinic).

3. Create an EC2 instance using your User Data shell script. Refer to the AWS CLI command you used in the previous section, add the `--user-data` flag and make sure to set the correct tags and the security group created above.

4. Once you have your User Data script working and instance setup create a second EC2 instance using the same User Data. Make sure to change the instance name and tags to differentiate it from the first.

**Tips**

- It can be easier to create an EC2 instance instance without `--user-data` manually figure out the steps required to get your web app running (document them). And then add your documented steps to your script. Keep in mind the script will run as root and when you ssh to a host it is usually as a non-root user.
- The EC2 instance will be slightly different from the virtual hosts or containers you have previously installed this software on so you will need to adapt the steps from your notes for this environment.
- Start off with a simple User Data script that only has a few steps, test those, fix any problems and then add more steps. Be patient and remember understanding how to troubleshoot installing software in different environments is an important skill.
- You can find output from your User Data script in `/var/log/messages`

### Deliverables

- Understand how User Data can be utilized to provision instances.
- Create a functional User Data script.
- Create two identical (except the tags) EC2 instances using the User Data script.
- Navigate to the application running within a browser.

## About Load Balancers

Load balancers distribute traffic from a single entry point across multiple servers. They can be used to increase performance as well as provide high availability of services.

**NOTE**: As of August 15th 2022, Classic Load Balancers have been deprecated and replaced with the following.

**Application Load Balancers** operate on layer 7, the request level, using HTTP and HTTPS. The routing purpose of using an ALB is for, but not limited to, microservices and containers.
**Network Load Balancers** handle layer 4, the connection level, utilizing TCP, UDP, TLS, etc. An NLB can handle millions of requests per second with excellent performance while maintaining low latencies.
**Gateway Load Balancers** allows for the ability to handle a large quantity of third-party virtual appliances. A GWLB can help improve security and policy controls.

Check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqJDac1H81I) by Whizlabs going over the differences between the new and old generations of load balancers.

## Exercise 2 - Setup a Network Load Balancer

In this exercise we will create a Network Load Balancer in AWS which distributes traffic to the two instances created.

First, we need to create a **Target Group** for our load balancer to be directed to.

1. Open the Amazon [console](https://console.aws.amazon.com).
2. Select *EC2* from the *Services* menu and click *Target Groups* in the left navigation bar.
3. Click *Create target group*.
4. Select *Instances* as the `target type`, set the name as `<your-name>-dob-petclinic`, protocol as *TCP* and port *8080*.
5. Set the *Health check protocol* to *HTTP* with a *Health check path* to */petclinic*. (Or any path that will return a 200 status code)
6. Use Liatrio's recommended tag structure (outlined in 4.1.1) to create tags. Hit *Next*.
7. Register the target instance, then click *Create target group*. Make sure you click "Include as pending below" before creating the Target Group.

Now we can create our Load Balancer.

1. Open the Amazon [console](https://console.aws.amazon.com).
2. Select *EC2* from the *Services* menu and click *Load Balancers* in the left navigation bar.
3. Click *Create Load Balancer*.
4. Under *Network Load Balancer* click *Create*.
5. Specify a name, such as `<your-name>-dob-petclinic`, set Scheme to *Internet-facing*, and the *IP address type* as IPv4.
6. Leave VPC alone and click two zones for mapping (us-west-1a and us-west-1b), make note of which zones you choose.
7. For the *Listener*, set the Protocol to *TCP* and port to *8080*. Then select the recently created target group.
8. Use Liatrio's recommended tag structure to create tags. Then click *Create load balancer*.

Make sure you can access your website via the Load Balancer DNS name.

**Tips**

- If you are not able to reach your website check the Target Group you created and ensure your hosts are 'Healthy'
- If they are not healthy double check your Inbound rules on your security group.

### Deeper Understanding

- In one of your instances try stopping your web service.
  - What is the health of the load balancer?
  - How long does it take for the health state to change?
  - Can you still access the application through the load balancer?
- Change some of the load balancer health check tuning settings and then restart your instance.
  - How long does it take for the health state to change?
- Modify the load balancer to serve your website on port 80.

### Deliverables

- Discuss as a group the benefits of load balancing traffic.
- Understand how to create a Classic Load Balancer with AWS.
- Understand how the load balancer uses health checks to manage traffic.
- Be able to view the application through the load balancer address.

## Exercise 3 - Launch Templates

**NOTE**: As of December 2022, 'Launch Configurations' is being migrated to 'Launch Templates'. At the time of writing 'Launch Configurations' was still the option shown in the side bar.

In this exercise we will create a Launch Template to automate creating EC2 instances.

1. Open the Amazon [console](https://console.aws.amazon.com).
2. In the search bar for 'Services' look up 'Launch Templates' (Located under the 'Features' tab).
3. Click *Create launch template*.
4. Name the Launch Template `[YOUR_NAME]-dob-[APPLICATION_NAME]`.
5. In the 'Application and OS Images' locate the AMI you used in exercise 1 (If you are still running those instances the 'Currently in use' option here makes finding this AMI easy).
6. Select t2.micro under the Instance type.
7. Select your key pair
8. Under the 'Network settings' section choose your security group.
9. Expand the *Advanced Details* panel in the *Additional configuration* section. Copy the contents of your user data script into the  *User data* text box.

10. Review the 'Summary' section to make sure things look good and click 'Create launch template'.

### Deliverables

- Discuss the possible uses for launch templates.

## 4. Auto Scaling Groups

![autoscaling image](img4/auto_scaling.svg ':size=70x70 :class=icon :alt= autoscaling image')

Below are instructions for setting up an Auto Scaling Group. Apply these instructions to your application.

1. Navigate to the Amazon [console](https://console.aws.amazon.com).
2. Select *EC2* from the *Services* menu and click *Auto Scaling Groups* in the sidebar menu.
3. Click *Create Auto Scaling group*.
4. Chose the *Launch Template* and *Use an existing launch template* options and then select the Launch template you created in the previous exercise. Click *Next Step*.
5. For the group name, name it [YOUR_NAME]-dob-[APPLICATION_NAME]. Select the availability zones associated with the load balancer created earlier. Click *Next*
6. Select "Attach to an existing load balancer" and choose the load balancer you created in exercise 2.
7. Under 'Health checks' select the `ELB` box opting into your load balancer health checks on top of the default EC2 health checks. Click *Next*
8. Set your *Desired capacity*, *Minimum capacity*, and *Maximum capacity* to 2. Click *Next*
9. Click *Next* through the 'Add notifications' section.
10. 6. Use Liatrio's recommended tag structure (outlined in 4.1.1) to create tags. Hit *Next*.
9. Review the Auto Scaling Group settings and click *Create Auto Scaling group*.
10. View the instances list to confirm the auto scaling group is creating instances based on your Launch Configuration.
11. Check the load balancer and confirm it also includes the instances created by the auto scaling group.

### Deeper Understanding

- Try stopping the web service service in an instance created by the auto scaling group.
  - What happens to the health status?
  - What happens to the instance?
- Try terminating an instances created by the auto scaling group.

## Clean Up

Look up and execute the AWS CLI commands to remove the auto scaling group, launch configuration, load balancer, EC2 instances, and security group created in this section. Check the AWS console to make sure all of the resources created in these exercises have been removed.
