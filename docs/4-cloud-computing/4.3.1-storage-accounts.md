# Azure Storage Accounts and CDN

In this section we will demonstrate how Azure Storage Accounts can be used to host a basic website, very similar to what you did in section 4.2.1 with S3 & CloudFront.

## Create an Angular site hosted on Azure Blob Storage

> An [Azure Storage Account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview) contains all of your Azure Storage data objects: blobs, files, queues, tables, and disks. The storage account provides a unique namespace for your Azure Storage data that is accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS. Data in your Azure storage account is durable and highly available, secure, and massively scalable.

For this exercise we will host a basic website on Azure Blob Storage built using [Angular](https://angular.io/docs).

1. Install the Angular CLI.

2. Create a new Angular project.

?> You can just accept the defaults when creating the new project. (Use enter button when presented with options)

3. Run the Angular application locally. A new browser session should be launched and you will see your Angular application with all the defaults. Feel free to explore Angular and make some changes to your default project before moving on to the build step.

4. You can close your application. Next you need to build the Angular application. If the build is successful, your deployment files will be contained within the "dist" sub-directory in your Angular project.

5. Log into Azure CLI. Using the Azure CLI, set the correct subscription to your account.

```bash
az login
```

?> When using Azure CLI, look for the commands that you need by using the -h flag.

```bash
az -h                                             # Goal: Set account subscription
az account -h
az account set -h
az account set --subscription "SUBSCRIPTION_NAME" # complete command
```

6. Using the Azure CLI, create a resource group and storage account.

?> At this point, you may want to consider using environment variables since many of the commands will use the same names for resource group, location, and storage account.

```bash
RESOURCE_GROUP=RG-YOUR_NAME-bootcamp
LOCATION=westus
STORAGE_ACCOUNT=YOUR_NAMEbasicwebsite123
```

?> Storage accounts in Azure have restrictions on naming. Lowercase and numbers only, no uppercase or special characters allowed!

7. Use [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) to validate creation.

8. Enable **static website** hosting on the storage account. *Hint - az storage blob service-properties update. [Azure Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/storage/blob/service-properties?view=azure-cli-latest#az-storage-blob-service-properties-update)

9. Deploy the website

```bash
az storage blob upload-batch \
  --account-name $STORAGE_ACCOUNT  \
  -s ./dist/APP_NAME \
  -d '$web'
```

10. Use Azure CLI or Azure Portal to find the URL for your storage account website. Save this URL to an environment variable named WEB_ORIGIN.

?>  The URL will follow the convention of accountname.regioncode.web.core.windows.net.

![Angular App Landing Page](img4/Angular-app-1.png ':size=912x400')

?> The example shown is for a new angular app. If you used the Hello World application, the landing page will be different.

### Enable Azure CDN for the website

> [Azure Content Delivery Network](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/cdn-overview) offers developers a global solution for rapidly delivering high-bandwidth content to users by caching their content at strategically placed physical nodes across the world. Azure CDN can also accelerate dynamic content, which cannot be cached, by leveraging various network optimizations using CDN POPs. For example, route optimization to bypass Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).

?> Here is some [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/scripts/cli/cdn-azure-cli-create-endpoint?toc=%2Fazure%2Ffrontdoor%2FTOC.json) that could be helpful for creating an Azure CDN.

11. Create the Azure CDN profile for the website.

12. Create the Azure CDN endpoint for the website.

13. Make sure you can reach the website using the Azure CDN endpoint.

?> It may take some time for the endpoint to become live.

14. Cleanup the resources you created by deleting the resource group.

## Deliverables

- What is the benefit of using the CLI vs the UI?
- What is the purpose of a resource group and why is it important?
- What key advantages did you discover about Azure Storage Accounts during this exercise?
- What were the key considerations when creating the Azure CDN profile for the website?
