Azure provides a wide variety of cloud computing services, from simple services like virtual machines to more complex services such as machine learning and cognitive search. The next sections will focus on the basics of interacting with Azure, organizing resources, and managing cost.

## Accounts, Tenants, and Subscriptions

When getting started with Azure, it is helpful to understand the relationship between accounts, tenants, and subscriptions. When a new account is created on Azure, a new Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant is automatically created with a default directory. Each tenant can have multiple subscriptions, which act as billing containers. Within each subscription, there can be many resource groups. Resource groups contain the actual resources (e.g. virtual machines, storage accounts)

> Azure AD Tenant -> Subscription -> Resource Group -> Resources

In many enterprises, this Azure AD tenant is synchronized with an on-premise Active Directory environment, allowing users to authenticate to applications on-premise or in the cloud with the same identity.

### Cost Management

The cost of using Azure services often depends on several different factors. For example, the cost of running an Azure Virtual Machine instance to host Jenkins would depend on the tier, instance size, amount of CPU time used, and the amount and type of storage. Microsoft provides a [cost calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/) to help estimate costs for most services.

When services must be running all the time, many enterprises will use Reserved Pricing with 1 or 3 year commitments to reduce costs. Within the Azure Portal, users can leverage [Cost Management and Billing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/cost-management-billing-overview) to analyze costs, setup budgets, and configure billing alerts.

The good news is that Azure provides a [free tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/free/free-account-faq/) to allow for learning and experimenting with their platform (such as completing the exercises in this bootcamp). If you are a Liatrio apprentice talk to your team lead to setup access to our Azure subscriptions, otherwise you can [create an account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/free/) to complete the upcoming exercises in Chapter 4.

## Organizing resources

### Overview

Organizing resources in Azure or any other cloud platform is important to properly manage security and costs. Deploying hundreds or thousands of resources in the cloud is only possible when using a carefully planned strategy for organizing your resources. The sections below describe the various options for organizing resources in Azure.

### Management Groups

Management Groups in Azure are a way to group multiple subscriptions or even other management groups. The use of [Management Groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/enterprise-scale/management-group-and-subscription-organization) isn't mandatory, but using them has advantages for large enterprises. It allows large enterprises to reflect their organizational structure in Azure and apply policy and access control based on that structure.

### Subscriptions

Subscriptions in Azure are logical containers to create billing separation. Each subscription can only be associated with one Azure AD tenant. It is common practice to have separate subscriptions for different environments (e.g. DEV, QA, Production) or different departments within an enterprise (e.g. Finance, Marketing).

### Resource Groups

Resources within subscriptions must be contained within a [Resource Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal). It is common practice for all resources related to a particular application to be contained within a single Resource Group. Every time you deploy a resource in Azure (e.g. Virtual Machine), you must deploy it into an existing Resource Group or create a new one.

### Resource Naming and Tagging

In most cases the name of a resource in Azure is immutable, so changing it later requires the destruction of the resource (this could be a lot of work!). Considering this, it is certainly a good idea to have a well thought out [naming convention](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/resource-naming) ahead of time. It is important to note that different resources in Azure have unique restrictions on naming, such as length or what characters are allowed.

Similar to naming conventions, having a well thought out [tagging strategy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/resource-tagging) is a good idea. Tags in Azure work basically the same as AWS, whereby they can provide information about the intended use of a particular resource, who the owner is, data classification, or other important metadata.

## Portal vs CLI

Once you are signed in to Azure you can use the web-based [portal](https://portal.azure.com/) to create and manage resources. The Portal is great for monitoring, troubleshooting problems, and making quick changes. Azure also provides a CLI tool and PowerShell cmdlets for creating repeatable / documentable steps, automating processes and text only environments. The exercises in section 4.3 will focus on using the CLI tool.

### CLI Setup

1. Install the [Azure CLI tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
2. Once installed, open up a terminal or command shell and run the command 'az login'.
3. Your web browser should open and you will be prompted to sign into your Microsoft account.
4. Once logged in, return to your terminal or command shell and confirm it has listed the subscriptions to which you have access.

## Deliverables

- Set up Azure CLI and verify you can interact with Azure with it
- Explore some [CLI commands](https://aka.ms/cli_ref), try them out. If you create any resources, make sure to delete them afterwards
