# EC2

The purpose of the exercise is to use EC2 to create VMs to host *something*. It is most beneficial to install/host *something* relevent in the DevOps space. In this exercise you will use EC2 to host a basic Jenkins setup.

## Jenkins

> [What's Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io): "Jenkins is a self-contained, open source automation server which can be used to automate all sorts of tasks related to building, testing, and delivering or deploying software. Jenkins can be installed through native system packages, Docker, or even run standalone by any machine with a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed."

Jenkins is generally used to setup [Pipeline workflows](https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-ci/latest/pipelines/):

![jenkins_workflow](./img4/cloudbees_jenkins_workflow.png ':class=light-mode-img-center :alt= cluster image; light mode')

> [Jenkins Controller - Agent Architecture](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/using/using-agents/): "The Jenkins architecture is designed for distributed build environments. It allows us to use different environments for each build project balancing the workload among multiple agents running jobs in parallel. The Jenkins controller is the original node in the Jenkins installation. The Jenkins controller administers the Jenkins agents and orchestrates their work, including scheduling jobs on agents and monitoring agents. Agents may be connected to the Jenkins controller using either local or cloud computers."

Jenkins is one of many CI/CD tools that you will likely interect with when working in the DevOps field.

`Optional`: Jenkins provides a [guided tour](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/tour/getting-started/) for hands on learning of the basics. Here you would install a "standalone" Jenkins instance locally and learn how to use the main feature of Jenkins, Jenkins Pipeline.

## Exercise

Through these steps you will build two servers on AWS, one as a Jenkins controller (*master*) and the other a Jenkins agent.

> Items in commands that are in all CAPS should be replaced with correct input.

1. Create an EC2 key pair in AWS.

2. Create an EC2 Security Group.

   - This security group is where you will handle port forwarding

> When you're creating a security group, it's important to be mindful of what traffic you're allowing. You should always follow the [Principle of Least Privilege](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-the-principle-of-least-privilege) when deciding what traffic you should allow to your instance to reduce the risk of unauthorized users accessing it, even in small-scale projects and exercises like this. In other words, your security groups should always only allow traffic from those who *need* to access your instance.

3. Create a Jenkins controller (*master*) instance and make of note of the Instance ID and Public DNS name.

   - Find a CentOS AMI on the marketplace.

```bash
aws-vault exec PROFILE_NAME -- aws ec2 run-instances --image-id AMI --count 1 --instance-type t2.micro --key-name KEY_PAIR_NAME --security-groups SECURITY_GROUP
```

4. Name your server, replace Justin with your name in lower case:

```bash
aws-vault exec PROFILE_NAME -- aws ec2 create-tags --resources INSTANCE_ID --tags "Key=Name,Value=justin-jenkins-controller"
```

5. Login to your host. The default username might be ec2-user, but you may have to search for the correct username, and you will have to use your private key file:

```bash
ssh -i PRIVATE_KEY_FILE -l USERNAME PUBLIC_DNS_NAME
```

6. Install Jenkins using Jenkins [install documentation](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/linux/) (*you can instore the hardware requirements since this installation is for learning purposes*)

7. To stop your instance at the end of the day:

```bash
aws-vault exec PROFILE_NAME -- aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids INSTANCE_ID
```

8. To start up your instance the next day:

```bash
aws-vault exec PROFILE_NAME -- aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids INSTANCE_ID
```

9. The DNS name is not persistent through shutdown and start. Run step 6 again to get the hostname of your instance.

10. Note we'll need to clean things up by the end of the week as running instances and their storage cost money.

**To permanently destroy and delete your instance:**

```bash
aws-vault exec PROFILE_NAME -- $ aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids INSTANCE_ID
```

### Create a Jenkins agent instance (open ended exercise)

1. Create an instance based on the previous steps and name it yourname-jenkins-agent. Do not install Jenkins on the agent however. To use this system as an agent, google for steps. Previous Liatrians have found these links useful:
   - <https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/using/using-agents/>
   - <https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2022/12/27/run-jenkins-agent-as-a-service/>
   - <https://gist.github.com/mgedmin/9547214>
   - <https://www.caktusgroup.com/blog/2012/01/10/configuring-jenkins-slave/>
> `Hint:` As a high level overview, you will need to create a private ssh key for the Jenkins user on the Jenkins controller (*master*). A Jenkins user will need to be created on the agent and the public key from the Jenkins controller (*master*) will need to be added to the authorized keys so the Jenkins controller (*master*) can ssh to the Jenkins agent and tell it to execute jobs and commands.
2. Create a [pipeline](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/) that has your Jenkins agent print out `hello world`. (Jenkins provides a [Getting Started with Pipeline](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/getting-started/#through-the-classic-ui) tutorial that will help you accomplish this task)

## Deliverable

Be familiar with Amazon's EC2 resource and how to create/destroy the resource.

Discuss the use cases of Jenkins in the software delivery life cycle. What stages of the SDLC could Jenkins be utilized in?
