      description: >
        Leverage mocking to test the user and repo checking functions. The code now exposes only two user and two repo check functions. Your tests should mock all API calls, cover both positive and negative scenarios, and use Jest's best practices for mocking and restoring. No real API calls should be made; focus on verifying the logic of the exported functions only.

        Use Jest spies to verify that when a repo name is invalid or not found, console.error is called and console.log is not. Write a test for the error case of getRepoInfo() using mocks and spies to check the correct error handling behavior.

# Managing Dependencies

When writing unit tests, it is important to isolate the code you are testing from any external dependencies that could result in false positives or negatives. Ensuring that your test only validates the business logic of the function you are testing.

Imagine you are writing a function `isBirthdayThisWeek(userId)` that checks if today is the user's birthday. This function has to fetch the user's birth date based on the `userId` from a database. In this case your test would not only depend on the database being up and running, but also the data in the database matching the assumptions of your test. On top of that this function would also depend on the getting the current date which would be ever changing. So how could you ever write a test for a function like this? Insert the concept of **test doubles**.

## Test Doubles

Test doubles are a way to isolate your code from external dependencies. Commonly referred to as "stubs", "mocks", or "fakes", these are objects that simulate the behavior of real objects in controlled ways. They allow you to test your code without relying on external systems, which can be slow, unreliable, or difficult to set up. In short mocking is a way to ensure that dependencies always return the same value, so that your test can have predictable results.

## Exercise 1: Phonies

For this exercise, you will use **mocking** with Jest to test a GitHub user and repo checking program. The code now exposes only two user and two repo check functions. Your task:

- Write tests for all four exported functions, covering both positive and negative scenarios.
- Use Jest's best practices: reset/restore mocks, use different mock return values, and check both expected and unexpected input.
- Mock all API calls; no real API calls should be made.
- Focus on verifying the logic of the exported functions only.

## Exercise 2: 007

For this exercise, you'll get to play "spy"â€”but in your code! A **spy** is a special kind of test double that lets you watch how a function is used, without changing what it does. Spies are great for checking if a function was called, how many times, and with what arguments.

Let's try it out:

- Write a test for the error case of `getRepoInfo()`. This function should use mocks to ensure the error case is hit and then use spies to verify that `console.error` was called with the correct message and that `console.log` was not called.

Try spying on different functions and see what you can discover! Spies are a fun way to "observe" your code in action.

# Deliverables

- What are some situations where mocking is especially helpful?
- Are there any downsides to using mocks in your tests?
- What does it mean to "spy" on a function?
- What types of questions can you answer with a spy that you can't with a mock?
