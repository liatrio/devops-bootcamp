# Unit Testing

Unit testing is the process of verifying that specific units of code are working as expected. Unit tests are typically concise
in nature, and they make assertions against a very specific part of the codebase - usually a single function.

The process for writing a unit test might look something like this:

1. Identify a function / method as the system under test (SUT).
2. Invoke the function / method with predefined arguments.
3. Observe the return value(s) of the function / method, and assert that they match the expected return value(s).

Unit testing is most effective against smaller functions that are scoped to a singular task. Functions that do multiple
tasks are typically more complex, and their input / output will usually reflect that.

Unit tests should be able to execute in isolation without requiring any other dependencies to be present. Functions that are
more complicated to test might also need to include mocks or stubs in order to fake some behavior, which will allow these
tests to run in complete isolation. For example, a function that makes an HTTP request to a server during its execution should
not do so when running the associated tests for this function. Instead, the code that performs the HTTP request should be
replaced with a mock to simulate this.

This allows unit tests to run quickly and consistently across all environments. Developers running unit tests on their own
machines should see the same test results as a CI server.

Fast and consistent feedback is extremely important when dealing with unit tests because a slow or flaky test suite will
discourage developers from running tests and contributing more tests to the codebase.

## Example

This example and the following exercise will deal with writing code and tests using Golang. If you are unfamiliar with Golang,
we highly recommend that you run through the exercises found at [Go By Example](https://gobyexample.com/). Please begin with
the [Hello World](https://gobyexample.com/hello-world) exercise, and stop when you are finished with the [Errors](https://gobyexample.com/errors)
exercise.

Let's suppose that we're working on a piece of code that works with a collection of GitHub repositories. Our UI needs to be
able to display all GitHub repositories organized by the organization they belong to. In order to do this, we need to create
a function that takes a slice of GitHub repositories and returns a map where each key represents a repository's organization,
and each value is a slice of repositories that belong to this organization.

This code might look something like this:

```go
package go_unit_test_bootcamp

type GitHubRepository struct {
 Organization string
 Repository   string
 Url          string
 License      string
}

func IndexGitHubRepositoriesByOrg(repos []*GitHubRepository) map[string][]*GitHubRepository {
 result := make(map[string][]*GitHubRepository)

 for _, repo := range repos {
  result[repo.Organization] = append(result[repo.Organization], repo)
 }

 return result
}
```

How should we test this? A good place to start might be with a very basic example. Let's see if we can verify that a slice
containing only a single repository can be indexed correctly.

```go
package go_unit_test_bootcamp

import "testing"

// Simple test - verify that a single repository is indexed correctly
func TestIndexGitHubRepositoriesByOrg_basic(t *testing.T) {
 repos := []*GitHubRepository{
  {
   Organization: "liatrio",
   Repository: "devops-bootcamp",
   Url: "https://github.com/liatrio/devops-bootcamp",
   License: "MIT",
  },
 }

 result := IndexGitHubRepositoriesByOrg(repos)

 if k := len(result); k != 1 {
  t.Errorf("expected result map to have one key, but it has %d keys", k)
 }

 if n := len(result["liatrio"]); n != 1 {
  t.Errorf("expected liatrio organization to have one repository, but it has %d", n)
 }
}
```

This takes care of a pretty basic scenario. What about something slightly more complicated? A test that works with a slightly
larger slice with more than one organization seems like a good next step.

```go
// More complicated test - verify that multiple repositories are indexed correctly
func TestIndexGitHubRepositoriesByOrg_multiple(t *testing.T) {
 repos := []*GitHubRepository{
  {
   Organization: "liatrio",
   Repository: "devops-bootcamp",
   Url: "https://github.com/liatrio/devops-bootcamp",
   License: "MIT",
  },
  {
   Organization: "kubernetes",
   Repository: "kubernetes",
   Url: "https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes",
   License: "Apache-2.0",
  },
  {
   Organization: "liatrio",
   Repository: "lead-terraform",
   Url: "https://github.com/liatrio/lead-terraform",
   License: "MIT",
  },
 }

 result := IndexGitHubRepositoriesByOrg(repos)

 if k := len(result); k != 2 {
  t.Errorf("expected result map to have two keys, but it has %d keys", k)
 }

 if n := len(result["liatrio"]); n != 2 {
  t.Errorf("expected liatrio organization to have two repositories, but it has %d", n)
 }

 if n := len(result["kubernetes"]); n != 1 {
  t.Errorf("expected kubernetes organization to have one repository, but it has %d", n)
 }
}
```

At this point, we're pretty confident that the code can handle more complicated scenarios. But what about edge cases? How
does our code handle an empty slice?

```go
// Edge case test - verify that zero input repositories results in an empty map
func TestIndexGitHubRepositoriesByOrg_empty(t *testing.T) {
 var repos []*GitHubRepository

 result := IndexGitHubRepositoriesByOrg(repos)

 if k := len(result); k != 0 {
  t.Errorf("expected result map to have zero keys, but it has %d keys", k)
 }
}
```

Let's try running these on your local machine. Make a new directory, and save the source code as a new file called `example.go`.
Then, organize each of the tests into a new file in that same directory, called `example_test.go`.
Finally, run `go test`. Do all of the tests pass?

## Exercise One - Pass some tests

In this exercise, you'll be given an interview-style programming problem, accompanied by a few tests to verify your solution.

The problem:

> You're working at a startup that utilizes airborne drones to deliver packages to customers. Every day, a fleet of drones
> will leave the warehouse to perform their deliveries for the day. When they're finished, they'll return to the warehouse.
>
> Every time a drone leaves the warehouse, its unique identifier (an integer) is recorded into a slice. When the drone returns,
> that same unique identifier will be recorded into that same slice a second time.
>
> One day, after taking inventory of the drones at the end of the day, you notice that one of the drones is missing! Luckily,
> each drone has a GPS locator that we can use to track it down, but first, we'll need to know the unique identifier of the
> drone. Can you write some code to find the unique identifier of the missing drone?
>
> tl;dr: Given a slice of all duplicate integers and one unique integer, find the unique integer.

The tests (save this as a file called `exercise_one_test.go`):

```go
package go_unit_test_bootcamp

import (
 "math/rand"
 "testing"
 "time"
)

func TestFindMissingDrone_basic(t *testing.T) {
 result := FindMissingDrone([]int{1, 3, 2, 2, 3})

 if result != 1 {
  t.Errorf("expected missing drone ID to be 1, got %d", result)
 }
}

func TestFindMissingDrone_basic2(t *testing.T) {
 result := FindMissingDrone([]int{1, 4, 4, 2, 3, 1, 2})

 if result != 3 {
  t.Errorf("expected missing drone ID to be 3, got %d", result)
 }
}

func TestFindMissingDrone_single(t *testing.T) {
 result := FindMissingDrone([]int{3})

 if result != 3 {
  t.Errorf("expected missing drone ID to be 3, got %d", result)
 }
}

func TestFindMissingDrone_random(t *testing.T) {
 rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())

 missingDrone := rand.Int()
 droneIds := []int{missingDrone}

 for i := 0; i < rand.Intn(20); i++ {
  randomDroneId := rand.Int()
  droneIds = append(droneIds, randomDroneId, randomDroneId)
 }

 rand.Shuffle(len(droneIds), func(i, j int) {
  droneIds[i], droneIds[j] = droneIds[j], droneIds[i]
 })

 result := FindMissingDrone(droneIds)

 if result != missingDrone {
  t.Errorf("expected missing drone ID to be %d, got %d", missingDrone, result)
 }
}
```

You can use this code to get started (save this as a file called `exercise_one.go`):

```go
package go_unit_test_bootcamp

func FindMissingDrone(droneIds []int) int {
 // TODO: implement this
 return -1
}
```

After saving these two files, make sure all of the tests fail by running `go test`. Once you have verified this, go ahead
and get started. You'll be finished with this exercise once your code has passed all of the tests.
