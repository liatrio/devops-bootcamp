# Agile

The Agile mindset is focused on collaboration and the ability to adapt to change quickly while focusing on delivering value to the customer. Agile utilizes an iterative approach that allows teams to respond to changing priorities and customer needs by working in small increments.

## Software Delivery Lifecycle

Traditionally, software development projects were often subject to lengthy release cycles that were managed in a compartmentalized manner. However, with the advent of iterative delivery approaches, these phases have been broken down into smaller, more manageable cycles that allow for increased feedback and collaboration.

To support this iterative delivery process, Software Delivery Lifecycle (SDLC) tools are commonly used to manage work at both the portfolio and individual levels. These tools utilize tickets and boards to facilitate task tracking and workflow management, while also providing powerful integrations across the entire toolchain.

By leveraging SDLC tools, organizations can achieve greater agility and efficiency in their software development efforts, as well as improve their ability to respond to changing market demands and customer needs.

## Agile Frameworks

Agile methodologies encompass a wide variety of frameworks, each with their own unique approach to team composition, work management, and cadence. Two of the most widely adopted frameworks are Kanban and Scrum, each of which aims to facilitate efficient collaboration, iteration, and task-swarming, albeit through different approaches.

Kanban is a framework that focuses on optimizing flow and visualizing work. It utilizes a board to represent work items, which move across different stages of the workflow as they are worked on by team members. The main objective of Kanban is to limit work in progress (WIP) to reduce bottlenecks and improve the overall efficiency of the team.

Scrum, on the other hand, is a framework that emphasizes frequent delivery of potentially shippable increments through time-boxed iterations called sprints. It consists of three main roles: the product owner, the development team, and the scrum master. The product owner is responsible for maintaining the product backlog and prioritizing tasks, while the development team is responsible for delivering the work. The scrum master facilitates the scrum process and helps the team remove any obstacles that may hinder their progress.

Both frameworks are designed to help teams work collaboratively and iteratively, with a focus on delivering value to customers in a timely and efficient manner. Ultimately, the choice of framework will depend on the specific needs and goals of the organization, as well as the preferences of the team.
