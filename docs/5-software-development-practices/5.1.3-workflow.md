# Workflow

Agile is focused on iterative delivery. This impacts how a team breaks down and manages their work through the software development life cycle. SDLC tools help manage this work.

## Work breakdown

In agile, stories form the basis of work items. Epics are a larger theme around a collection of stories, or they can be seen as a longer-lived goal. Subtasks can be broken out during sprint planning as a team or in-sprint by engineers.

| Ticket | Purpose | Duration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Epic** | Large bodies of work, feature-focused or higher, spans multiple sprints | 1-4 iterations |
| **Story** | Typical unit of work, driven by the product owner | 1 day |
| **Subtask** | Small amount of work that lives under a story or task | <1 day |

## Workflow

**Backlog.** The backlog is a list of all work items that are waiting to be brought in for development. In Kanban, items are pulled from backlog; in Scrum, items are brought in during planning.

**Kanban Board.** Teams use kanban boards to track their work in progress (WIP), using columns *To Do, In Progress, and Done*. During standup, teams may "walk the board" and review the status or blockers of each item on the board.
