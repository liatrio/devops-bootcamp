# Scrum

Scrum is an agile framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products. It is designed for teams of ten or fewer members (two pizza teams), who break their work into goals that can be completed within timeboxed iterations, called sprints, no longer than one month and most commonly two weeks. The scrum team tracks progress in time-boxed daily scrum meetings or stand-ups. At the end of the sprint, the team holds a sprint review to demonstrate the work done, and sprint retrospective to continuously improve.

Scrum emphasizes collaboration around breaking goals into timeboxed intervals. Important metrics are sprint burndown, release burnup, and velocity.

- Work is allocated for a sprint, generally two weeks
- Promotes feedback loops with each sprint
- Finished work is seen as unused inventory or technical debt until the sprint is closed
- Does not support continuous deployment as a release would not occur mid-sprint
- Encourages continuous improvement through reviews and retrospectives after each sprint

# Sprint Cadence

Scrum breaks work into timeboxed sprints. Generally, sprints are one or two weeks, and should not be longer than two weeks. Shorter sprints provide more feedback which amplifies the team's learnings and guides better iterative delivery. Each sprint should have a 1-2 sentence goal describing a quick and easy statement for stakeholders to read and understand what the team is working on.

# Team Composition

Product teams work in a way where the delivery team agrees to deliver on a promise. Together, they have the responsibility to fulfill that promise, but how they organize in a way to execute that promise is up to them.

Traditionally, agile scrum teams are made up of the product owner and the development team. However, teams should be oriented in such a way that the team members can self-organize to accomplish the task. Additionally, teams should be cross-functional to help support one another and learn from one another to complete work items.

### Development team: redefining a developer

The development team is composed of the people doing the engineering and development. They are empowered to self-organize and manage their work, optimizing their effectiveness and efficiency. This empowers the people closest to the work to do what’s needed to solve the problem. The developer role means a team member who has the right skills, as part of the team to do the work, including designers, writers, programmers. Although there are different skillsets present across team members, together they form a unified cross-functional team.

### The development team’s responsibilities include:

- Delivering the work through the sprint.
- To ensure transparency during the sprint they meet daily at the daily standup.

### Product owner: setting clear direction

Agile teams are, by design, flexible and responsive, and it is the responsibility of the product owner to ensure that they are delivering the most value. The business is represented by the product owner who tells the development team what is important to deliver. Trust between these two roles is crucial.

The product owner should not only understand the customer, but also have a vision for the value that the team is delivering to the customer. The product owner also balances the needs of other stakeholders in the organization.

### The product owner's responsibilities include

- **Managing the scrum backlog** - Ultimately they are responsible for the backlog that the development team pulls in to deliver. That means the product owner should know about everything that is in the backlog and other people that add items to the product backlog should ensure that they communicate with the product owner.
- **Stakeholder management** - Any product will have many stakeholders involved ranging from users, customers, governance, and organizational leadership. The product owner will have to work with all these people to effectively ensure that the development team is delivering value.

### Scrum master: holding it all together

Some teams may have a **scrum master** who is responsible for gluing everything together and ensuring that scrum is being done well. In practical terms, that means they help the product owner define value, the development team deliver the value, and the scrum team improve over time.

# Ceremonies

Establishing a base for the team's ceremonies helps create a rhythm and cadence. Utilizing agile practices of the scrum framework, teams typically have the following core ceremonies to ensure teams are aligned and focused on high priority items, and to support continuous learning efforts.

| Ceremony | Purpose | Duration | Audience |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| **Refinement** | Refine backlog stories, update with outstanding questions and point stories that are fully refined. | 1hr | Everyone |
| **Sprint Planning** | Confirm backlog stories are fully defined and pointed and decide which stories to pull into the upcoming sprint. | 30min | Everyone |
| **Stand up** | Daily team touch point. Walk the board or discuss work accomplished yesterday, work planned for today, and blockers  | 15 min | Everyone |
| **Demo & Retro** | Demonstrate code changes to the team, product owner, and stakeholders. Discuss what went well and what improvements can be made. | 1hr | Everyone |

3 Amigos, part of BDD practice, include 30 minute sessions with relevant team members to surface questions and assumptions around product, development, and testing. Although some teams decide to incorporate this into a regularly cadenced ceremony, other teams follow the recommendation to have them adhoc.

### Backlog refinement

A well-prioritized agile backlog not only makes release and iteration planning easier, but it broadcasts all the things your team intends to spend time on - including internal work that the customer will never notice. This helps set expectations with stakeholders and other teams, especially when they bring additional work to you, and makes engineering time a fixed asset.

### Sprint planning

The purpose of sprint planning is to define what can be delivered in the sprint and how that work will be achieved. Sprint planning is done in collaboration with the whole scrum team. A well-defined backlog brought into the sprint should result in an efficient session reviewing the stories, points, and acceptance criteria.

### Stand up

Each day, the scrum team gathers to discuss the day's work. Although it can easily become a mundane meeting, it should remain as a sharp, crisp, critical touchpoint. Able to be led by anyone on the team, there are two common approaches to running standup:

1. **Walk the board.** This approach looks at the tickets on the board and reviews the status of each. The emphasis of WTB is the work in progress.

2. **Around the room.** This approach asks everyone on the team the following questions, highlighting individual progress and blockers.

- What did I do yesterday?
- What am I doing today?
- Are there any blockers?

### Sprint review

As teams close out their sprint, they should dedicate an hour to conduct a demo and retrospective. This allows teams to showcase their work to one another and to stakeholders. Retros enable teams to consider what worked well and what did not work well, providing opportunities for ongoing learning and improvement.
