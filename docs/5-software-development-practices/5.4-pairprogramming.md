# Pair Programming

Pair programming keeps both programmers fully aware of what is happening in the code. It encourages communication and is a direct implementation of the idea that "two heads are better than one."

Pair programming happens by having two developers share one computer to get the work done. If someone is working remotely, they can screen-share, as well.

## Remote Pair Programming

To get started download [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

Once you have VSCode set up, select the "Extensions" tab on the mini-bar on the left. Search for "Live Share". You should see "Live Share" and "Live Share Extension Pack" extensions. Install both of them. Both extensions will have instructions on how to install and use them.

After you have all the plug-ins installed, navigate to the Live Share logo on the activity bar on the left. From there, the "Session Details" will allow you to either share or join a workspace.

The Live Share Extension Pack allows participants to communicate through text chat or audio calls. These options will be listed in the Session Details.

Visual Studio Live Share enables you to collaboratively edit and debug with others in real-time, regardless of what programming languages you're using or app types you're building. It allows you to instantly (and securely) share your current project, and then as needed, share debugging sessions, terminal instances, localhost web apps, voice calls, and more!

Visual Studio Extension Pack includes everything you need to start collaboratively editing and debugging in real-time, including integrated audio and text chat.

## Why VSCode for Pair Programming?

VSCode allows users to collaboratively work on the same code at the same time,  allowing for instant feedback. VSCode also works really well for a wide variety of languages. The most important distinction between VSCode and other editors is that it is free to use. It also comes pre-packaged with a lot of useful features; IntelliSense, extension marketplace, version control, GitHub integration, and many    [more](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/whyvscode).

Not only does VSCode allow participants to share projects in real-time, they are also able to communicate through VSCode directly via text or audio chat.

## VSCode Pair Programming Alternatives

- [AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) is a cloud-based integrated development environment used to author and debug source code. With Cloud9, you can quickly share your development environment with your team, enabling you to pair program and track each other's inputs in real-time. In cases where an enterprise does not permit the installation of software on client laptops, Cloud9 still provides a robust means of accessible, pair programming.

- [Jetbrain's IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) tool lets you use the Code With Me plugin to allow participants to share their locally running project with anyone. You can use Code With Me for real-time collaboration, editing code, sharing a server, and running a debugging session.

!>JetBrain's IntelliJ IDEA service is a yearly subscription.

# Deliverable

Try out pair programming with someone to program an application that prints "Hello World" using a language of your choice.
