# GitHub

For a lot of people when you say Git they think of GitHub which is not surprising since GitHub has created a huge community of individuals and organizations around the use of Git. GitHub lets you host, share and manage Git repositories with an easy-to-use HTML interface. GitHub also offers some other project management features such as issue tracking, documentation, releases, and CI/CD pipelines.

For the most part, GitHub repositories work just like normal Git repositories. You can clone them, create and merge branches, commit changes and push them back up to GitHub. GitHub also adds a few features which are not included in Git which are worth taking note of.

# Pull Requests

A pull request (PR) is a process to review and approve changes from one branch before they are merged into another. A pull request can be created from one branch to another (usually a main branch) in the same repository or from a forked repository (see below) to its source.

After a pull request is created in GitHub it can be reviewed by viewing a side-by-side comparison of code being added and removed. It allows for people to comment on and requests changes to specific sections of code. People can be requested to review changes or rules can be set up to require reviews from specific people or a minimum number of reviews before a pull request is approved. Once a pull request is approved it can be merged and closed.

?> Pull request history persists on the Git server. Branches will be deleted and commits may be squashed, but the PR will persist to provide transparency on changes. All details will be retained, including code changes, reviewers and approvals, status changes, and comments.

### Peer Reviews: A Sacred Space for Developers

Apart from quality gates, PRs provide an opportunity to perform honest, robust, and friendly code reviews. It is a sacred space often utilized only by the developers, as it narrows the audience to low-level code reviews.

During PRs, developers will work together to ensure that the code meets the business value promised by the work item. Common discussions will revolve around scope creep, optimizing implementation, and alignment on the team's code norms.

Additionally, this process will help share knowledge of the application across the entire team, as opposed to a select circle of lead developers. This helps reduce tribal knowledge and can help with onboarding newer or junior members to the team.

Good peer reviews during pull requests help create strong and high performing teams that:

- check each other's work to protect the quality of the product
- hold each other accountable
- over-communicate and over-share information as often as possible
- stay aligned on both the business value delivered and its implementation
- build a higher level of quality into the product early in the development process

# Forks

Forking a GitHub repository copies it to either your personal repositories or the repositories of an organization you have the proper access to. It is essentially the same as cloning a repository and then pushing it up to a new GitHub repository except that forking links the copied repository to its source which allows you to make pull requests back to the original repository.

A common use case is for individuals to contribute to open source projects by forking the project, committing changes to their fork, and then creating a pull request to merge their changes into the official project.

### Exercise: Forks and PRs

This exercise is an opportunity to explore GitHub's features. There are a lot of bells and whistles to play with and you are encouraged to explore beyond the following instructions which are meant to get you started. If you don't already have a GitHub account [create one](https://github.com/join).

1. Fork [Spring PetClinic](https://github.com/liatrio/spring-petclinic) and clone your fork.

2. Create a branch, commit some changes and push your changes back up to GitHub.

3. In GitHub create a pull request for your new branch.

!> When making a pull request on a forked repository be sure to select your own repository as the base repository and not the official repository unless you are actually requesting them to merge your changes into their project. The is a common but embarrassing mistake and an annoyance for large project maintainers.

4. Experiment with adding comments and making additional changes to the PR. If you are working in a group request that someone else review your PR and requests changes on someone else's PR.

# GitHub Alternatives

GitHub is one of the most well-known platforms for hosting and managing Git repositories but it is not the only one. Atlassian has a product called [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product) which is available as a service or a self-hosted product. [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/) is a CI/CD platform that includes Git repository hosting and many other features similar to GitHub.

# Deliverable

Be familiar with GitHub's features.

Find additional examples to source repository solutions similar to GitHub and discuss the pros and cons of each.

Discuss the benefits and downsides of using pull requests to merge code within
a project.

Discuss why an enterprise organization may or may not want to use GitHub.
