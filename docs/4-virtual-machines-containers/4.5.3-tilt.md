# 4.5.3 Tilt

## The Microservice Development Challenge

Modern software commonly follows microservice architecture. In this architecture, containers are the best way to run your workloads, enabling a more independent software delivery lifecycle, immutable design, packaged environments and applications, scalable nature, and much more. When running containerized workloads, Kubernetes has emerged as the primary platform for orchestrating and running these workloads.

This is not without its own struggles. If your production environment is Kubernetes, then you now need to author and maintain Kubernetes manifests to describe how your application will run inside of Kubernetes. Given this reality, you now have a disconnect between your local environment and your production environment. Even if you are locally building and running a container with Docker Compose, you are now describing how your application runs in two places and, more importantly, your local environment (Docker Compose in this situation) differs from your production environment, Kubernetes.

So to make sure we are testing in an environment that closely matches our production environment, you can develop against a local cluster like `k3d` or `minikube`. This _works_ but it is painful. Now you are developing your application → building your image → pushing your image to some registry → running `kubectl apply -f <files>` → setting port forwards → locally testing your application.

If Kubernetes is _where_ we run our applications but we develop them locally and test our containers with tools like Docker Compose, then there is a large disconnect between how our containers run locally and how they run in production.

Containers solved the application environment parity by bundling the environment and the application in the image. However, the development experience gap between local development and production-like environments remains a significant challenge for engineering teams working with microservices.

## What is Tilt?

[Tilt](https://tilt.dev/) is a developer tool specifically designed to remedy the pain points of microservice development in a Kubernetes environment locally (or remotely). Tilt helps with discoverability, saving you many keystrokes, supporting smart rebuilds and live reloading so that your Kubernetes development loop feels as seamless as a local development loop with hot reloading, but you get the confidence of knowing you are testing your images and your manifests.

Key features of Tilt include:

- **Smart rebuilds**: Only rebuilds what has changed
- **Live sync**: Syncs code changes directly into running containers
- **Web UI**: Provides a dashboard to monitor your services
- **Port forwarding**: Automatically manages port forwards for your services
- **Log aggregation**: Centralizes logs from all your services

## Exercise 1: Old school

In order to explore and grasp the benefit that Tilt adds to the development experience, we are going to work through what it's like at different stages.

Leveraging an Agentic IDE like VS Code, prompt AI to create a monorepo with two microservices for a todo app. You should have a frontend service and an API service. Prompt the AI to pick whatever framework/language you are interested in, but the frontend and the backend should be different.

1. **Prompt AI to create your simple todo microservice app**
    - Create a frontend service using vanilla HTML/JavaScript served by Express.js
    - Create an API service using Python Flask
    - Ensure they can communicate with each other

2. **Run and play with your new toy app**
    - Start both services locally
    - Test the basic todo functionality (create, read, update, delete)

3. **Attach VS Code's visual debugger and step through a request to your API**
    - Follow the [VS Code debugging documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging)
    - Set breakpoints in your API code
    - Make a request from the frontend and step through the API logic

4. **Experience adding a new feature when we have a purely local app**
    - Update the API so that it can accept a `due_date` field
    - Add a default due date if none is provided
    - Make sure you are interactively stepping through code to validate functionality
    - Additionally, include log statements and verify in logs that your application is behaving as expected

Hopefully, you found this experience pretty straightforward and got a taste for how critical interactive debugging can be to an engineer's development process.

## Exercise 2: Put a container on it

Modern software is increasingly shifting from VM-based workloads to containerized workloads. This has many operational benefits from isolation, scaling, and immutability but does come with their own challenges. One challenge faced by engineers working with containerized applications is the effect this has on developer experience. Now building, testing, and debugging are all affected.

1. **First, containerize both of your sample apps**
   - Create Dockerfiles for both the frontend and API services
   - Build and test the containers locally
   - Ensure they can still communicate with each other

2. **Develop a new feature with containers**
   - Before you can comfortably develop, you want access to your developer tools
   - Run a container and then ensure you can attach your VS Code debugger to your running container
   - This may require configuring your containers to expose debug ports

3. **Add support for `due_date` to the frontend**
   - Tasks should display due dates
   - When creating todo items, you should be able to specify a due date
   - Make sure you are interactively stepping through code to validate functionality
   - Additionally, include log statements and verify in logs that your application is behaving as expected

## Exercise 3: Were going to need a bigger boat

A natural fit for deploying, managing, releasing, and orchestrating your containerized workloads in production is Kubernetes. Though the benefits for running production workloads in a Kubernetes environment are numerous and often a large motivating factor for moving from VM workloads to containerized workloads, it does come with its trade-offs for the development loop.

1. **Begin by creating manifests for your applications**
   - Create Deployment and Service manifests for both your frontend and API
   - Consider using ConfigMaps for configuration
   - Ensure proper networking between services

2. **Create a `k3d` local cluster and deploy your applications**
   - Install [k3d](https://k3d.io/) if you haven't already
   - Create a local cluster: `k3d cluster create dev-cluster`
   - Deploy your applications using `kubectl apply`

3. **Port forward and verify your application works**
   - Use `kubectl port-forward` to access your services
   - Test the full application functionality

4. **Experience the development loop for an application running in Kubernetes**
   - Add support for a `priority` field (low, medium, high) to the API
   - Update methods as needed and default to `medium`
   - Make sure you are interactively stepping through code to validate functionality in Kubernetes
   - Additionally, include log statements and verify in logs that your application is behaving as expected in Kubernetes

> If you find yourself using config files or other tools to streamline this process, that's ok (cough k9s), but if you find yourself writing bash scripts to wrap `docker` or `kubectl` commands, stop. One thing I want you to experience is the steps required in a development loop for each of these iterations.

Kubernetes dev loop got you tilted? Tilt it up! Tilt is a developer tool specifically designed to remedy the pain points of microservice development in a Kubernetes environment locally (or remotely).

1. **Download and install Tilt**
   - Follow the [Tilt installation guide](https://docs.tilt.dev/install.html)
   - Verify installation with `tilt version`

2. **Create a Tiltfile that will do the following:**
   - Intelligently rebuild your `api` and `ui` only when you change application code
   - Rebuilds should go to a local registry for speed
   - Live sync application code into the running container, saving needless rebuilds
   - Configure port forwarding for both debug and application endpoints
   - Ensure you **only** update your testing k3d cluster

3. **Test your Tilt setup**
   - Run `tilt up` and ensure you can:
     - Easily access your applications through the Tilt web UI
     - Change your application code and see it reflected in your app **without** triggering a rebuild of your image
     - Change a dependency of your app and verify that your image was rebuilt and updated in your cluster

5. **Add support for `priority` to the frontend**
   - Tasks should display priority
   - When creating todo items, you should be able to specify a priority
   - Make sure you are interactively stepping through code to validate functionality in Kubernetes
   - Additionally, include log statements and verify in logs that your application is behaving as expected in Kubernetes

**Challenge** Complete as many of the following as you can:
- Only have one Dockerfile
- Use a distroless image such as Chainguard images.
- Ensure your manifests have production ready securityContext configuration like the following:

```yaml
securityContext:
    runAsNonRoot: true
    runAsUser: 1000
    allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
    readOnlyRootFilesystem: false
```
