# Declarative Pipelines

A Declarative Pipeline is a method for automating the process of setting up a pipeline in jenkins. To do this we will be using a Jenkinsfile. Jenkinsfiles contain the definition of a Jenkins Pipeline in steps and is checked into source control to be used by jenkins. 

### Example Jenkinsfile
```
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building..'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Testing..'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying....'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

``` agent any ```
- Execute this Pipeline or any of its stages, on any available agent

``` stages ```
- Lists the stages that will be executed in this pipeline, for this example there are 3:
	- Build
	- Test
	- Deploy

``` stage('Build') ```
- Defines a stage 'Build'.

``` steps ```
- Performs some steps related to the 'Build' stage.

``` stage('Test') ```
- Defines a stage 'Test'.

``` steps ```
- Performs some steps related to the 'Test' stage.

``` stage('Deploy') ```
- Defines a stage 'Deploy'.

``` steps ```
- Performs some steps related to the 'Deploy' stage.

> Note: Stage name can be anything, and there can be any number of stages. Link to Jenkins Documentation on Pipelines: https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/

## Exercise

1. Using your Jenkins and Artifactory instances from the previous section, implement a Jenkinsfile to automate your pipeline. 
    - For the three projects spring-petclinic, joda-time hibernate, and junit your projects should build, test, and deploy each to Artifactory.
    - When deploying to Artifactory, do not use plugins and instead use shell commands and the [Artifactory API](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Artifactory+REST+API).
2. Setup each Pipeline to build and test every branch, but only deploy from the master branch. 

## Multi-Branch Pipeline
There is a Multi-Branch Pipeline job type in Jenkins that is very similar to the singular Pipeline job, but rather than only monitoring master it will monitor all branches. It will also allow you to test everytime you push onto a branch. It won't automatically only deploy from the master branch.



# Deliverable

Describe why a declarative pipeline is used with Jenkins and Artifactory.
