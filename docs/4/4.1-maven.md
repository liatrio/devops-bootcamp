## Introductory Reading

Starting out, you should read the following articles.
 - [Maven in 5 Minutes](https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html)
 - [Introduction to the POM](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-pom.html)
 - [Introduction to the Dependency Mechanism](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html)
 - [Introduction to the Build Lifecycle](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html)

## Working Example

Clone [spring-petclinic](https://github.com/liatrio/spring-petclinic) and try out each phase of the Maven lifecycle.

## Practice

 1. Create a new application using the archetype.
```
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-webapp
```
 2. Add Jetty to `pom.xml`.
```
<build>
	<plugins>
		<plugin>
			<groupId>org.mortbay.jetty</groupId>
			<artifactId>maven-jetty-plugin</artifactId>
			<version>6.1.10</version>
			<configuration>
				<scanIntervalSeconds>10</scanIntervalSeconds>
				<connectors>
					<connector implementation="org.mortbay.jetty.nio.SelectChannelConnector">
						<port>8080</port>
						<maxIdleTime>60000</maxIdleTime>
					</connector>
				</connectors>
			</configuration>
		</plugin>
	</plugins>
</build>
```
 3. Run Jetty.
```
mvn jetty:run
```
 4. Investigate the Maven Internal (local) repo. What does it contain? What is its purpose?
 5. What changes occur in the project directory and the local repo when running `mvn package` and when running `mvn install`?
 6. Modify dependencies/versions using the POM by opening `pom.xml` and changing the versions of dependencies to get different versions to be used in the project. Locate them in the Maven repo.
 7. Change spring-petclinic's GAV.
 8. Alter one of spring-petclinic's open-source dependencies, such as jodatime-hibernate.
   - Change the jodatime dependency in spring-petclinic to use `9.2.1-SNAPSHOT`.
   - After building, the build should fail. Why?
 9. Clone jodatime and create a new version of the plugin.
   - Change the version to be the missin version from before.
   - Build the "new" version which is stored in the local Maven repo.
 10. Run spring-petclinic build and verify it was successful.

# Deliverable

Discuss the significance of the POM, dependencies and where they are sourced, and versions from a Maven perspective with your group.
