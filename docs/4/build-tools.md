# Build Tools

Build tools play an import part in software releases. Aside from building the actual application they can be leveraged to automate other tasks to get the product to a releasable state such as running tests, package the application into an artifact, deploy artifacts to a repository, etc.

In this section we will focus on how Maven can be leveraged to automate tasks to release an application. Keep in mind there are lots of other build tools with similar features. Also keep an eye out limitations for using build tools for this purpose as we will be looking at other approaches later in this chapter.
