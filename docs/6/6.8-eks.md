# EKS 

In this section we'll be exploring the functionality and use of Amazon's Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS). Similar to ECS, EKS allows users to manage containers distributed amongst various AWS instances. However, where ECS is an amazon specific container orchestration tool, EKS utilizes the popular container management platform Kubernetes to manage containers on AWS. 

> Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (Amazon EKS) is a managed service that makes it easy for you to run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to stand up or maintain your own Kubernetes control plane. Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. [Amazon EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/what-is-eks.html)

Although AWS provides ECS as a container management tool, the popularity of Kubernetes spurred the creation of EKS. Before EKS, Kubernetes was commonly used in conjunction with AWS resources, so amazon created EKS to make the integration between Kubernetes and AWS seamless. EKS runs the Kubernetes management infrastructure behind the scenes so that the user only has to worry about adding worker nodes to their cluster. Both native kubernetes and EKS both use kubectl as a tool to interact with clusters, so experienced users of Kubernetes will find it easy to transition to EKS. 

If you are still having a difficult time understanding what Kubernetes is that is OK. Kubernetes is complicated and we are not going to try to explain all of it in this section.
