# Building AWS Images with Packer
Packer Basics
In this section we will be talking about the tool Packer. Packer is an open source tool that allows teams to create multiple machine images or virtual machines with the same setup. With Packer, teams will be less likely to run into the issue of a solution only working on one machine. It is worth noting Packer is lightweight and is capable of running on every major operating system today and it is very popular to use additional tools such as Chef and Ansible to further install software on the machine image.

## Exercise - Creating A Base Image
  ![](img6/packer.png)

In this exercise we will be using the tool Packer to create a base Linux AMI image on AWS or Linux Virtual Machine Image with the tool Chef installed.

1.) First install Packer locally on your machine.

2.) Next take a look at a few examples on how to create Packer configuration files (JSON files).

3.) Next configure the Variables and Builders section of your JSON file. This is where you would define things such as where you want to build your image.

4.) Next look into the Chef-Solo provisioner or Shell Provisioner to install Chef on top of your image.

5.) Finally, verify your image was successfully created by spinning up a new instance or virtual machine and confirming the version of Chef inside the instance.

6.) Verify your AMI was created by navigating to the AWS console
