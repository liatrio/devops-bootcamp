# EC2

## Exercise

Through these steps you will build two servers on AWS, one as a Jenkins master and the other a Jenkins agent.

1. Create a key pair in AWS.

4. Create a Jenkins master instance and make of note of the Instance ID and Public DNS name.
```
aws-vault exec PROFILE_NAME -- aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-d0f506b0 --count 1 --instance-type t2.micro --key-name AWS_KEY --security-groups jenkins
```

5. Name your server, replace i-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx with your instance ID and replace Justin with your name in lower case:
```
aws-vault exec PROFILE_NAME -- aws ec2 create-tags --resources [INSTANCE_ID] --tags "Key=Name,Value=justin-jenkins-master"
```

7. Login to your host. The default username is ec2-user and you will have to use your private key:
```
ssh -i [PRIVATE_KEY_FILE] -l ec2-user [PUBLIC_DNS_NAME]
```

10. Install Jenkins. Use your notes from earlier in the bootcamp.

12. To stop your instance at the end of the day:
```
aws-vault exec PROFILE_NAME -- aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids [INSTANCE_ID]
```

13. To start up your instance the next day:
```
aws-vault exec PROFILE_NAME -- aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids [INSTANCE_ID]
```

14. The DNS name is not persistent through shutdown and start. Run step 6 again to get the hostname of your instance.
15. Note we'll need to clean things up by the end of the week as running instances and their storage cost money.

**To permanently destroy and delete your instance:**

```
aws-vault exec PROFILE_NAME -- $ aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids [INSTANCE_ID]
```
### Create a jenkins agent instance (open ended exercise):

1. Create an instance based on the previous steps and name it yourname-jenkins-agent. Do not install jenkins on the agent however. To use this system as a agent, google for steps. I found these links useful:
   - https://gist.github.com/mgedmin/9547214
   - https://www.caktusgroup.com/blog/2012/01/10/configuring-jenkins-slave/
2. As a high level over view you will need to create a private ssh key for the jenkins user on the jenkins master. A jenkins user will need to be created on the agent and the public key from the jenkins master will need to be added to the authorized keys so the jenkins master can ssh to the jenkins agent and tell it to execute jobs and commands.


## Deliverable

1. Run multiple application deploys.
