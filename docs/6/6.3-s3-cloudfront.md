# S3 & CloudFront

In this section we will run through several exercises which showcase AWS S3 and CloudFront. Each exercise builds on the previous so make sure you understand each step before moving onto the next.

## Create a Website use an S3 bucket

> Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is the largest and most performant, secure, and feature-rich object storage service. With Amazon S3, organizations of all sizes and industries can store any amount of data for any use case, including applications, IoT, data lakes, analytics, backup and restore, archive, and disaster recovery. -- [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)

For this exercise we hosting a static HTML website using AWS S3. We will use the [Cause Jekyll template](https://github.com/CloudCannon/cause-jekyll-template) to create our sample website. Feel free to get creating and substitute a different template or project.

**Requirements**
- Ruby (Install Ruby with [RVM](https://rvm.io/))


1. Clone the Cause Jekyll template `git clone https://github.com/CloudCannon/cause-jekyll-template.git`.

2. Change to template directory `cd cause-jekyll-template`.

3. Generate the HTML for the template.
```
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll build
```

4. **Optional** Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open http://localhost:4000 to confirm that the website is setup.

5. Create the S3 Bucket. Replace *YOUR_NAME* with your name and *PROFILE_NAME* with the name of the AWS cli profile you setup. The region requires a location constraint be specified because it is not in us-east-1.
```
aws-vault exec PROFILE_NAME -- aws s3api create-bucket --bucket YOUR_NAME-dob-causejekyll --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=us-west-2
```

6. Verify that the S3 bucket was created in the AWS console.

7. Configure the Bucket for Static Website Hosting. This command specifies the bucket as one that hosts static website content as well as specifies which files to be used for the home page and error page. Don't forget to change the *YOUR_NAME* and *PROFILE_NAME* values.
```
aws-vault exec PROFILE_NAME -- aws s3 website s3://YOUR_NAME-dob-causejekyll --index-document index.html --error-document 404.html
```

8. Add tags to the S3 Bucket.
```
aws-vault exec PROFILE_NAME -- aws s3api put-bucket-tagging --bucket YOUR_NAME-dob-causejekyll --tagging 'TagSet=[{Key=Client,Value=Internal},{Key=Project,Value=DOB},{Key=Environment,Value=Demo},{Key=Application,Value=Cause Jekyll},{Key=Owner,Value=YOUR_NAME}]'
```
9. Verify the tags where created in the AWS console.

10. Upload the contents of the *_site* folder, which contains the HTML generated from the template, to our S3 bucket. The ACL flag specifies that this content will be readable by the public, which allows people visiting the website to view it.
```
aws-vault exec PROFILE_NAME -- aws s3 sync _site s3://YOUR_NAME-dob-causejekyll --acl public-read
```

11. Navigate to http://[your-bucket-name].s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com to confirm that all steps were followed properly.

## Create a Web Distribution for your S3 Website using CloudFront

> Amazon CloudFront is a web service that speeds up distribution of your static and dynamic web content, for example, .html, .css, .php, image, and media files, to end users. CloudFront delivers your content through a worldwide network of edge locations. When an end user requests content that you're serving with CloudFront, the user is routed to the edge location that provides the lowest latency, so content is delivered with the best possible performance. If the content is already in that edge location, CloudFront delivers it immediately. If the content is not currently in that edge location, CloudFront retrieves it from an Amazon S3 bucket or an HTTP server (for example, a web server) that you have identified as the source for the definitive version of your content.
 --- [AWS Docs on CloudFront](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/index.html#lang/en_us)

This exercise will enable a Web Distribution using CloudFront for the S3 website we just
 deployed, and create an alias Record Set to forward traffic from a subdomain using liatr.io.

1. Create the CloudFront Distribution. This command specifies what URL and root object to use as the origin for the web distribution. Then take note of the created distribution's ARN, Domain Name, ID and ETag that the command outputs. The ARN can be used to add tags, the domain name is where you can reach your distribution on the web, and the ID and ETag is used to delete the distribution.
```
aws-vault exec PROFILE_NAME -- aws cloudfront create-distribution --origin-domain-name YOUR_NAME-dob-causejekyll.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com --default-root-object index.html
```

2. Navigate to the outputted CloudFront Domain Name to view your S3 content now distributed using a Web Distribution. This enables your S3 content to be accessible as fast as possible for users.

3. Tag your Distribution using the ARN from the output of step 1.
```
aws-vault exec PROFILE_NAME -- aws cloudfront tag-resource --resource ARN --tags 'Items=[{Key=Client,Value=Internal},{Key=Project,Value=DOB},{Key=Environment,Value=Demo},{Key=Application,Value=Cause Jekyll},{Key=Owner,Value=YOUR_NAME}]'
```

4. Verify the tags are added to your Distribution in the AWS console.

## Cleanup

The following commands delete all objects in the bucket, remove the bucket and delete the distribution.

**These commands are dangerous! Make sure you actually want to delete, and double check your syntax.**

1. Remove all Objects from the S3 Bucket.
```
aws-vault exec PROFILE_NAME -- aws s3 rm s3://YOUR_NAME-dob-causejekyll --recursive
```

2. Delete the empty S3 Bucket.
```
aws-vault exec PROFILE_NAME -- aws s3api delete-bucket --bucket YOUR_NAME-dob-causejekyll
```

3. Get the configuration for the distribution, using its ID from the command earlier, and save it to a file.
```
aws-vault exec PROFILE_NAME -- aws cloudfront get-distribution-config --id ID > distribution-config
```

4. Edit the `distribution-config` file so that it only contains the contents of the *DistributionConfig* field and change `Enabled` to false.

5. Disable the distribution and record the ETag from the output.
```
aws-vault exec PROFILE_NAME -- aws cloudfront update-distribution --id ID --if-match ETag --distribution-config file://distribution-config
```

6. Delete the Distribution using its ID and the ETag from the update-distribution command.
```
aws-vault exec PROFILE_NAME -- aws cloudfront delete-distribution --id ID --if-match ETag
```
