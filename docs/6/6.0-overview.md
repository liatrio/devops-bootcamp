# 5.0 Release Management

So far we have learned about how DevOps affects managing software environments using virtual machines and containers and software development. Now we will focus on the next step of software delivery which is how we release projects that are ready to be tested or deployed to production. This is often an afterthought for developers but deployment processes are critically important to being able to release more frequently and provide feedback back to developers. 

## Chapter Goals
 1. Become acquainted with Semantic Versioning.
 2. Create declarative pipelines as a more flexible continuous delivery solution. 
 3. Learn how tools like Maven, NPM, Make and GoReleaser affect software delivery.
 4. Learn how containers affect software delivery.
