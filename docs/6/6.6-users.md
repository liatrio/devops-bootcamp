# Users

In enterprise organizations, it's important that different users have different
levels of permissions with critical systems. Some engineers may have access to
create, destroy, or edit resources, whereas others may only have permission to
view relevant data. In this way, employees can be given access to what they
need, while still keeping sensitive information and critical systems safe.

In this exercise, we'll update the pipeline you created earlier in the chapter
to include user permissions. We'll set up users with nearly full permissions
who represent administrators, as well as setting up users with more restricted
permissions.

## Jenkins

Jenkins users can be created under the `Manage Jenkins => Manage Users` menu.

- Create at least two users, one who will be an administrator and one who will
not.
- Try out logging in as your new users.

User Permissions can be edited under the
`Manage Jenkins => Configure Global Security` menu. By default your new users
should have full permissions, however we'd like to better model an enterprise
by restricting those permissions.

- Configure your Jenkins to allow one of your users full
permissions, but restrict the other to read only.
- Log in as both users and confirm your permissions were set as expected.

## Bitbucket

Work through the same steps as before, but this time with Bitbucket. In the end
you should have at least two users, one with full permissions, and one with
read-only permissions.

Bitbucket also allows users to authenticate with ssh keys, such as for commit
authentication. Set up ssh keys for your new users.

You may have noticed that Bitbucket supports group permissions by default.
Groups are a convenient way to handle permissions. For example, a
developer group might have read and write access, but be restricted from
administrative permissions. When a new developer joins the team,
they can simply be added to the group, rather than having to assign each
required permission manually.

## Pipeline

Now that your users are set up, we'll use them to configure a simple pipeline.

1. Using your admin user in Bitbucket, create a new spring-petclinic
repository.
2. Using your admin user in Jenkins:
  - Create a build for the repository
  - Configure a post-commit hook to trigger builds on new commits.
  - Create a scheduled job to deploy your most recent build to Tomcat every
four hours.

Your non-admin users will be able to see your repository and build, but they
shouldn't be able to edit them.

# Deliverable

Have a Jenkins job build from a Bitbucket repository, deploy to Tomcat, and have specific users able to edit the Jenkins configuration, and others users only able to view it.

Discuss why having different users and different user permissions is important
in an enterprise setting.
