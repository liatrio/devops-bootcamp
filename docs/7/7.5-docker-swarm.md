### Creating a scalable cluster of Docker Swarm nodes

1. Read [getting started with swarm mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/) to familiarize yourself with the swarm installation process.
2. Configure a Swarm manager instance and a scalable set of Swarm worker instances. Install Docker engine on each instance. 
3. Use remote-exec to initialize Swarm on the manager instance.
4. Use remote-exec to join the Swarm on the worker instances.
  -  [Configure the manager docker daemon](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#linux-configuration-file) to accept tcp connections on a specific port from all hosts. 
  -  Obtain the worker join-token remotely with **$(docker -H <manger_address>:<port> swarm join-token -q worker)**
  -  Don't expose the docker daemon port to the world! Be sure to configure your security groups properly. 
5. Verify that the swarm cluster is functional.
6. Think about the swarm's network set up. Is it secure?
