# Chef

## Overview

This lab is designed to give you a base understanding of Chef and how it works. This tool is one of the most popular configuration managers and is used by many engineering teams to create better experiences for their customers and teams. Liatrio has some Chef Repos that you can see at [GitHub/Liatrio-chef.](https://github.com/liatrio-chef) 

### Chef Basics

Read about Chef and determine the following questions:

- What type of architecture does chef use? Agentless, Master-Agent, etc. 
- What is a cookbook?
- What is a wrapper cookbook?
- What is a recipe?
- What is an attribute?
- What is metatdata?
- What is Berkshelf?
- What is a databag?
- What is ChefDK?
- What is ChefSpec?
- What is Testkitchen?
- What is Rubocop?
- What is Foodcritic?
- What is the Supermarket?
- What is Chef Solo?
- How do you use Vagrant for local Dev?

You can get most of this information on:
- [Chef.io](https://www.chef.io/)
- [Learn.chef.io](https://learn.chef.io/)
- [Foodcritic.io](http://www.foodcritic.io/)
- [Vagrant Chef Solo Provisioner](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/provisioning/chef_solo.html)
- [About Cookbooks](https://docs.chef.io/cookbooks.html)

> ### Discuss your findings with your peers

## Exercise 

1. Install ChefDK on your system if it is not currently.
2. Create Wrapper Cookbook of Nginx.
   - Add file to the home directory called name.txt with your name without using default recipe. 
   - No Ruby Errors
   - No Foodcritic Error
   - There must be ChefSpec for it 
   - Use Vagrant for local development. 
3. Create a static Hello, world html page. (if there's time). 
4. Install Chef Server on AWS instance.
5. Upload Nginx cookbook to chef server
6. Bootstrap a new AWS instance with Nginx cookbook. 

> ### Note:
- Vague steps on purpose - ask leader for clarification if need be
- There are more than one way to get to the same outcome - be prepared to talk about your method.
- We will discuss at every section so be sure to keep each other on pace. 

## Deliverables 

- What was the hardest part of this?
- How may local testing help?
- What do you think of Chef?

## Consultant Deliverables

1. What is this tool?
2. How is it used in an enterprise?
3. Licensing costs
4. Liatrio's POV/uses for Chef
5. Explain pros and cons
6. Create high level deck explaining Chef. Coordinate with your team to also have a technical demo
7. Once an engineer has completed this exercise work with them to run through steps 4-6
