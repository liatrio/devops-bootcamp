# 8.3 Probes

## Probes in Kubernetes

Probes provide a uniform interface to manage the health of workloads in a Kubernetes cluster. They allow the kubelet to automatically monitor the health of pods and take action when required to allow traffic to be sent to the pod or restart it if it is unhealthy. Misconfigured probes can easily cause applications to not run correctly and can be difficult to troubleshoot so it is important to understand how they are supposed to function.

#### When to use a readiness probe

- To know when a container is ready to start receiving traffic. Runs on the container during its whole lifecycle.

#### When to use a liveness probe

- To know when a container needs to be restarted.  Runs on the container during its whole lifecycle.

#### When to use a startup probe

- To know when a container starts up. Runs on the container during startup only.
  - Disables liveness and readiness checks until it succeeds, making sure those probes don't interfere with the application startup.
  - Beneficial for slow starting containers, prevent the kubelet from killing them before they are up and running.

### Shared Configurable Fields

| Field               | Description                                                                           | Default (sec) |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| initialDelaySeconds | Time till the probe starts running after container startup.                           |       0      |
| periodSeconds       | How long the probe will run.                                                          |      10      |
| timeoutSeconds      | Probe timeout.                                                                        |       1      |
| successThreshold    | The number of successful probes necessary for a container to be marked healthy/ready. |       1      |
| failureThreshold    | How many times a probe will try before deeming unhealthy/not ready.                   |       3      |

### Setup

1. Using Docker Desktop, create a service of type NodePort in the default namespace. This step can be done imperatively as well. Fulfill the specifications below:
    - Name is `nginx`
    - A label *and* selector with the key `app` and value `nginx`
    - Port `80`

2. Create a deployment:
    - Name is `nginx`
    - A label *and* selector with the key `app` and value `nginx`
        - Ensure the matchLabels field aligns with this key and value
    - The name of the container and the image are likewise `nginx`
    - A container port of `80`
    - `1` replica

3. Check the logs prior to adding any probes. You should see output similar to:
![readiness probe before image](img8/logs-before-readiness-probe.svg ':class=img-center :alt= readiness probe before image')

### Startup Probe Config

1. Add a startup probe to the deployment:
    - initialDelaySeconds set to 5
    - periodSeconds set to 5
    - timeoutSeconds set to 2
    - Configure the startup pod to `cat` the nginx configuration file

2. Check the logs, they should look the same as before. This is because the startup probe's command returns a 0 if it succeeds, and the kubelet considers the container to be alive and healthy. If it fails, then the container is killed and restarted.

### Readiness Probe Config

1. Add a readiness probe to the deployment:
    - initialDelaySeconds set to 1
    - periodSeconds set to 2
    - successThreshold set to 2
    - failureThreshold set to 3
    - Configure `httpGet` to have a path of `/` and a port of `80`

2. Check the logs now. Notice there are now GET requests from the probe every 2 seconds as specified by the default value for the "periodSeconds" field, indicating that nginx is ready to receive traffic.
![readiness probe after image](img8/logs-after-readiness-probe.svg ':class=img-center :alt= readiness probe after image')

### Liveness Probe Config

1. Add a liveness probe to the deployment:
    - initialDelaySeconds set to 10
    - periodSeconds set to 5
    - Configure `httpGet` to have a path of `/index.html`and a port of `80`
    - Add a `hostPath` volume and `volumeMount`
    - Use this simple html landing page for your index.html

### Deliverables

- Why might you use the same configuration for a startup probe and liveness probe?
- Determine whether liveness probes wait for readiness probes to succeed.
