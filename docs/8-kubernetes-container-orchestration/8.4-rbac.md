# 8.4 RBAC

## RBAC in Kubernetes

RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) is the most widely used means of controlling access to Kubernetes API resources by restricting how and what a user can do given their assigned role permissions.

API Objects for configuring RBAC: Role, ClusterRole, RoleBinding, and ClusterRoleBinding.

?> RBAC is not the only authorization mode in Kubernetes; there's also Node, ABAC, and Webhook.

| Authorization Mode | Description                                                                                                                                                |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| RBAC               | (Role-based Access Control) is a method of regulating access to computer or network resources based on the roles of individual users within an enterprise. |
| Node               | Grants permissions to kubelets based on the pods they're scheduled to run.                                                                                    |
| ABAC               | (Attribute-Based Access Control) grants rights to users based on policies that combine attributes together.                                                |
| Webhook            | Is an HTTP callback; a simple event-notification via HTTP POST.                                                                                            |

### Role/ClusterRole

- Roles are namespaced, ClusterRoles are not.
- Specify resources like pods or namespaces and the possible interactions with these resources such as *get*, *list*, and *watch*.

### RoleBinding/ClusterRoleBinding

- RoleBindings are namespaced, ClusterRoleBindings are not.
- Bind a Role to a user to enable the necessary, granular permissions for carrying out specific tasks. Enforces the best practice of assigning the least privilege.

### When to Use ClusterRoles/ClusterRoleBindings Over Roles/RoleBindings

- To define permissions for cluster-scoped resources (like nodes).
- For non-resource endpoints (like /healthz).
- For namespaced resources (like pods), across all namespaces.
  - For example: you can use a ClusterRole to allow a particular user to run `kubectl get pods --all-namespaces`.

## Grant New Permissions to a ServiceAccount

1. Using Docker Desktop, create a namespace imperatively for Jenkins with aid of the `kubectl create --help` command.

2. Install Jenkins in the new "jenkins" namespace using helm.
`helm repo add jenkins https://charts.jenkins.io`<br>
`helm repo update`<br>
`helm install jenkins jenkins/jenkins -n jenkins --version 5.1.26`
   - The name of the chart is jenkins/jenkins - found by running `helm search repo jenkins`.
   - If you have issues getting your pod up and running, please try updating the chart version.

3. Discovery<br>
After installing the helm chart for Jenkins, what new roles did it add in the "jenkins" namespace? Role bindings? Service accounts?

4. Create credentials using a Kubernetes secret. Replace the values for username and password with your own:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
# this is the jenkins id
  name: liatrio-jenkins-secret
  namespace: jenkins
  labels:
# secret type
    "jenkins.io/credentials-type": "usernamePassword"
  annotations:
# description - can not be a label as spaces are not allowed
    "jenkins.io/credentials-description" : "credentials from Kubernetes"
type: Opaque
stringData:
  username: 'YOUR_USERNAME'
  password: 'YOUR_PASSWORD'
```

5. Setup Jenkins and install the "Kubernetes Credentials Provider" plugin. You should notice a Kubernetes store appear under "Stores Scoped to Jenkins" in the "Credentials" section but your secret above isn't showing up. This is because Jenkins cannot access Kubernetes secrets by default. Having Jenkins access this new secret will require giving it a new role and role binding in Kubernetes.
![before secrets image](img8/before-secrets-rbac.svg ':class=img-center :alt= before secrets image')

5. Create a new role for jenkins named "jenkins-read-secrets" in the "jenkins" namespace to read Kubernetes secrets. Use the labels and annotations specified below. Give this role a rule to get/watch/list secrets.

```yaml
  annotations:
    meta.helm.sh/release-name: jenkins
    meta.helm.sh/release-namespace: jenkins
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/component: jenkins-controller
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: jenkins
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: Helm
    app.kubernetes.io/name: jenkins
    helm.sh/chart: jenkins-3.10.3
```

6. Create a role binding for your "jenkins-read-secrets" role in the "jenkins" namespace using the same name and annotations/labels as in the previous step. Specify the same ServiceAccount you found during the "Discovery" step.

7. Refresh the "Credentials" pages and you'll now be able to see your Kubernetes secret in Jenkins.

## Verifying RBAC Permissions

Service accounts, (cluster) roles, and (cluster) role bindings can also be created imperatively with `kubectl create --help`. Create the resources below using this approach in Docker Desktop.

1. A namespace named "test-rbac".

2. A service account named "fluentd" in the "test-rbac" namespace.

3. A cluster role "fluentd" with the ability to get, list, and watch pods and namespaces.

4. A cluster role binding "fluentd" configured to use the service account and role you just created.

5. Check access.
    - `kubectl auth can-i list namespaces --as system:serviceaccount:test-rbac:fluentd` - *yes*
    - `kubectl auth can-i watch pods --as system:serviceaccount:test-rbac:fluentd` - *yes*
    - `kubectl auth can-i delete secrets --as system:serviceaccount:test-rbac:fluentd` - *no*

If the last command outputted "yes", you may need to patch the cluster role binding "docker-for-desktop-binding" with:<br>

```bash
kubectl patch clusterrolebinding docker-for-desktop-binding --type=json --patch $'[{"op":"replace", "path":"/subjects/0/name", "value":"system:serviceaccounts:kube-system"}]'
```

or try updating Docker. Otherwise, this role binding will give __*all*__ service accounts the cluster-admin role, effectively defeating the purpose of RBAC.

To see the full list of permissions for the "fluentd" service account, use: `kubectl auth can-i --list --as system:serviceaccount:test-rbac:fluentd`

### Deliverables

- Determine whether it's possible to add deny rules to roles.
- What service account is a pod assigned if one is not specified? Why must a pod always have a service account configured?
