# Liatrio and DevOps

This might be your first apprenticeship; if so, congratulations! You might get this question at some point.

> "What do you guys _do_?"

Well...

We are a consulting firm aimed at helping large corporations increase their productivity and ability to deliver and deploy software in a timely manner. Another way to look at it is by asking the following question.

>How long does it take for your company to deploy software with one line of code difference?

Sometimes the answer is staggering, and we try to change that.

## Boots on the Ground
Currently, Liatrio is a boots-on-the-ground DevOps Consulting group, meaning that our teams are actually on-site working face-to-face with clients to help them streamline their production. We work with a multitude of clients, and each one has their own specific issues. This is why it is so important to be working personally with them; our employees identify issues that hinder development and help produce a solution. Our goal is to uplift them as a team both technologically and culturally to revitalize the development and IT teams.

## The Rise of DevOps
Building software has changed greatly in the last couple decades. ~15-20 years ago, we had small teams of people who would work together on software which would then be built by a Tech Lead. The issue was that many issues could arise and things like merge conflicts or version conflicts became troubling. Since then, many tools have been created changing the way we do things as well as how we visualize the pipeline. DevOps affects all levels of software development from the individual developer to the production server(s). Many processes/tasks are now automated allowing more builds to flow through the pipeline.

## The Goal
The goal is to take the pain out of software delivery and deployment.

1) The developer gets quick feedback. Fast feedback loops allow the developer to work on their code while their mind is in the right place. Addressing these issues as quickly as possible keeps the integrity of the code base. The developer should be testing their code and verifying their code is what the product needs.

2) The automation of the SCM and build server keep code moving through the pipeline and return the feedback that we talked about before. The build server has a very important job despite being seemingly simple.

3) The artifacts delivered are product! Remember this! Every build created could potentially go to production. The other thing is programs can depend on other artifacts. We use tools such as Maven and Nexus to keep track of dependencies and versions.

4) One of the biggest goals of DevOps is to build a culture similar to startups: Agile mindset. Close Team. Open Communication. Responsibility. Accountability.
