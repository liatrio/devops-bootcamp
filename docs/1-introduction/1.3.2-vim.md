# Vim
Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text editing.
It is an improved version of the vi editor distributed with most UNIX systems.
Vim is often called a "programmer's editor," and so useful for programming that
many consider it an entire IDE. It's not just for programmers, though. Vim is
perfect for all kinds of text editing, from composing email to editing
configuration files.

Throughout this bootcamp you will often have to edit files on remote servers.
Since you will not be able to use a graphical text editor having a working
knowledge of `vim` and `vi` will allow you to easily make your changes.

## Modes
Normal editors like Atom or VSCode are considered _modeless_ editors which
means there is only one mode, where you input text. Vim is a _modal_ editor
with three primary modes:

| Mode | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Insert | Insert text as if it was a normal editor |
| Normal | Move around the file and manipulate text |
| Visual | Select blocks of text |
| Command | Select commands to Vim |

### Normal Mode
By default Vim starts in **Normal** mode. Normal mode can be accessed from
other modes using `Esc`. Normal mode key presses don't work as you would
expect them to. Here are some commands that will work:

| Command | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `i` | Switches Vim to insert mode |
| `h` or `left arrow` | Moves the cursor left one character |
| `j` or `down arrow` | Moves the cursor down one line |
| `k` or `up arrow` | Moves the cursor up one line |
| `l` or `right arrow` | Moves the cursor right one character |
| `w` | Move cursor to beginning of next word |
| `b` | Move cursor to beginning of previous word |
| `e` | Move cursor to end of next word |
| `0` | Move cursor to the beginning of the line |
| `$` | Move cursor to the end of the line |
| `yy` | Copy current line into buffer |
| `p` | Paste line in buffer |

There are many other ways of inserting text and navigating the file but these are
some of the easiest examples. Remember that Vim is not made to stay in insert mode
most of the time, so the more comfortable you become in Normal mode the better!

### Insert Mode
Insert mode is the one that will be the most familiar. Once you are in Insert mode
you can simply type characters like a normal text editor.

| Command | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `i` | Switch Vim to insert mode |
| `esc` | Switch Vim to normal mode |
| `a` | Moves the cursor after the current character and enters insert mode |
| `A` | Moves the cursor to the end of the line and enters insert mode |
| `o` | Inserts a newline below current line and enters insert mode |
| `O` | Inserts a newline above current line and enters insert mode |

### Visual Mode
Visual mode is used to select text similar to clicking and dragging text with
a mouse. Once text is selected you can apply commands such as copying, deleting,
and replacing.

| Command | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `v` | Enter visual mode and mark selection start point |
| `y` | Copy current selection into buffer |
| `d` | Delete current selection |

### Command Mode
Command mode lets you send commands to Vim that you wouldn't be able to do with
Normal mode.

| Command | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `:` | Insert Command Mode |
| `w` | Save the file |
| `q` | Quit Vim |
| `wq`| Save and quit from Vim |

## Exercise
1. Open a new file called `hello_vim.txt`
2. Add some text to your file
3. Save and exit Vim
4. Verify that your changes were saved
