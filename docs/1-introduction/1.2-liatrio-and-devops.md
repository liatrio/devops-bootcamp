# Liatrio and DevOps

This might be your first apprenticeship; if so, congratulations! You might get this question at some point.

> "What do you all _do_?"

Well...

We are a consulting firm aimed at helping large corporations increase their productivity and ability to deliver and deploy software in a timely manner. Another way to look at it is by asking the following question.

> How long does it take for your company to deploy software with one line of code difference?

Sometimes the answer is staggering, and we try to change that.

## Boots on the Ground

Liatrio is a boots-on-the-ground DevOps Consulting group, meaning that our teams are actually on-site working face-to-face with clients to help them streamline their production. We work with a multitude of clients, and each one has their own specific issues. This is why it is so important to be working personally with them; our employees identify issues that hinder development and help produce a solution. We help to uplift clients both technologically and culturally to revitalize development and IT teams.

## The Rise of DevOps

DevOps has revolutionized software development within the last couple decades. At the turn of the century, it was common that development teams would work on independent pieces of a project, which would ultimately have to be merged and compiled by a tech lead at the end of a project. This led to an enormous problem. If code didn't merge together and function as expected, a team might not know until very late in the development process, or even until after deploying. Since that time, developers have created processes and tools to help build, test, and manage code throughout the life of a project. Those tools and processes help form the foundation of what we know today as DevOps.

## The Goals

DevOps practices aim to take the pain out of software delivery and deployment.

1) Developers learn about code issues as soon as possible. Fast feedback loops allow the developer to fix code issues without switching to another task or forgetting how the code functions. Addressing issues as quickly as possible also maintains the code's integrity and ensures that it's always in a working state. Feedback isn't just about a program's functionality though. Good feedback loops should also let developers hear from users and help guarantee that features are actually useful to customers.

2) Automation of source code management (SCM) and build servers. SCM tools keeps everyone on the same page about the state of a code base, while build servers validate the functionality and quality of code.

3) Every build could potentially go to production. While not every change necessarily needs to be released immediately, it's valuable to have enough automation and validation that any changes _could_ go to production if desired.

4) A culture similar to that of Startups. An agile mindset. Close-knit teams. Open and transparent communication. Individual responsibility and accountability.

## The Tao

The Tao of Liatrio is the foundational values that guide our work, vision, strategy, and delivery for ourselves and our clients. We carry these philosophies in mind at all times to guide our decision making, inspire us to always bring our best selves, and to understand why we work the way we do.

### Become an Ally for Our Customers

- We challenge our customers through empathy and positive leadership. We act as change agents to help them accomplish their goals.
- Many principles and technologies we introduce are new to our customers. We don't work with our clients to "be right", we help them understand why something is right for them.
- Our customers know their business better than we do. We listen and learn in order to create mutual outcomes WITH clients, not just for them.
- We understand that we aren't the hero, we're the advisor/mentor. We're not Luke Skywalker, we're Yoda.

### Continuous Improvement

- Technology is never in a final state; it's always on a road of improvement. Transformation isn't a destination, it's a never-ending journey.
- Behavioral and cultural practices are also not permanently set. We help our customers continuously improve not only on an organizational level, but on a holistic and personal level too.
- Prioritizing improvement of a system's overall flow yields the greatest benefit in delivery improvement. Once faster flow is achieved, it's easier to solve individual problems.

### Culture of Feedback

- We advocate for fast feedback, through Proof of Concept (PoC), a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), or any other similar approach. Fast feedback allows us to gauge progress and make small, iterative moves aligned to what the feedback is signaling.
- We work to prove or disprove an idea as early as possible in order to best adjust our approach to a problem.
- While mistakes (technical and non-technical) do happen, we look at them as learning opportunities.
- Celebrating wins is equally important to teams and delivery work too. We make sure to pause and celebrate when the team wins.

### Strong Opinions, Loosely Held

- Strong Opinions means that we are confident in our positions and stand behind them -- we are passionate, motivated, and informed in our professional opinions.‚Äç
- Loosely Held means that we are always willing to challenge our opinions and can listen to and collaborate respectfully with other points of view. [Source](https://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/07/strong_opinions.html)

### Community Builders

- Community is critical for the success of software development. We strive to create, enhance, and build community wherever possible.
- We use collaborative tools such as Slack, GitHub, etc. in order to encourage the behavior of excessive transparency and oversharing -- thus allowing everyone to have situational awareness.
- Open source encourages community building and adds immediate value for our clients and ourselves. We embrace open source in both tools and mindset.
