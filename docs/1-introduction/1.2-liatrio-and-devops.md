# Liatrio and DevOps

This might be your first apprenticeship; if so, congratulations! You might get this question at some point.

> "What do you all _do_?"

Well...

We are a consulting firm aimed at helping large corporations increase their productivity and ability to deliver and deploy software in a timely manner. Another way to look at it is by asking the following question.

> How long does it take for your company to deploy software with one line of code difference?

Sometimes the answer is staggering, and we try to change that.

## Boots on the Ground

Liatrio is a boots-on-the-ground DevOps Consulting group, meaning that our teams are actually on-site working face-to-face with clients to help them streamline their production. We work with a multitude of clients, and each one has their own specific issues. This is why it is so important to be working personally with them; our employees identify issues that hinder development and help produce a solution. We help to uplift clients both technologically and culturally to revitalize development and IT teams.

## The Rise of DevOps

DevOps has revolutionized software development within the last couple decades. At the turn of the century, it was common that development teams would work on independent pieces of a project, which would ultimately have to be merged and compiled by a tech lead at the end of a project. This led to an enormous problem. If code didn't merge together and function as expected, a team might not know until very late in the development process, or even until after deploying. Since that time, developers have created processes and tools to help build, test, and manage code throughout the life of a project. Those tools and processes help form the foundation of what we know today as DevOps.

## The Goals

DevOps practices aim to take the pain out of software delivery and deployment.

1) Developers learn about code issues as soon as possible. Fast feedback loops allow the developer to fix code issues without switching to another task or forgetting how the code functions. Addressing issues as quickly as possible also maintains the code's integrity and ensures that it's always in a working state. Feedback isn't just about a program's functionality though. Good feedback loops should also let developers hear from users and help guarantee that features are actually useful to customers.

2) Automation of source code management (SCM) and build servers. SCM tools keeps everyone on the same page about the state of a code base, while build servers validate the functionality and quality of code.

3) Every build could potentially go to production. While not every change necessarily needs to be released immediately, it's valuable to have enough automation and validation that any changes _could_ go to production if desired.

4) A culture similar to that of Startups. An agile mindset. Close-knit teams. Open and transparent communication. Individual responsibility and accountability.

## The Tao

Culture and the importance of culture to the effectiveness of an organization has been mentioned multiple times up to now. Take some time to read the [About Liatrio](https://www.liatrio.com/about) page to learn about the basis of Liatrio's own culture. Go back and re-read this page every so often; the Tao is central to our ways of working, and is vital to keep in mind.
