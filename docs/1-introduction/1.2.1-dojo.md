# What is the dojo?

A dōjō (道場) is a Japanese word for a space focused on immersive learning. At its core, the Dojo is a cultural movement focused on helping organizations improve and accelerate their software delivery.
Teams and leaders leave the Dojo experience motivated and excited after applying modern software delivery techniques to their own product.
The Dojo provides an immersive, hands on experience that improves a team’s way of thinking and working so that organizations can deliver products faster to customers. This dedicated experience and immersive learning helps organizations to improve upon:

* Culture: Enables a change in mindset and behaviors for both the delivery teams and their leadership.
* Practices: Learn new technical and non-technical practices, apply and reinforce knowledge to shift teams toward modern ways of working.
* Experimentation: Immersive, distraction free environment that allows teams to apply experiments and learnings by failing early and fast.
The best learning and growth happens only when people apply newly gained skills to their product backlog and are able to break past existing organizational constraints.
