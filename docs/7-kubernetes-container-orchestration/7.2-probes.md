# 7.2 Probes

## Probes in Kubernetes

#### When to use a readiness probe:
- To know when a container is ready to start receiving traffic. Runs on the container during its whole lifecycle.

#### When to use a liveness probe:
- To know when a container needs to be restarted.  Runs on the container during its whole lifecycle.

#### When to use a startup probe:
- To know when a container starts up. Runs on the container during startup only.
    - Disables liveness and readiness checks until it succeeds, making sure those probes don't interfere with the application startup.
    - Beneficial for slow starting containers, prevent the kubelet from killing them before they are up and running.

### Shared Configurable Fields

| Field               | Description                                                                           | Default (sec) |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| initialDelaySeconds | Time till the probe starts running after container startup.                           |       0      |
| periodSeconds       | How long the probe will run.                                                          |      10      |
| timeoutSeconds      | Probe timeout.                                                                        |       1      |
| successThreshold    | The number of successful probes necessary for a container to be marked healthy/ready. |       1      |
| failureThreshold    | How many times a probe will try before deeming unhealthy/not ready.                   |       3      |

### Setup
1. Using Docker Desktop, create a service of type NodePort in the default namespace. This step can be done imperatively as well. Fulfill the specifications below:
- Name is `nginx`
- A label *and* selector with the key `app` and value `nginx`
- Port `80`

2. Create a deployment:
- Name is `nginx`
- A label *and* selector with the key `app` and value `nginx`
    - Ensure the matchLabels field aligns with this key and value
- The name of the container and the image are likewise `nginx`
- A container port of `80`
- `1` replica

3. Check the logs prior to adding any probes. You should see output similar to:

### Startup Probe Config
1. Add a startup probe to the deployment:
- initialDelaySeconds set to 5
- periodSeconds set to 5
- timeoutSeconds set to 2
- Configure the startup pod to `cat` the nginx configuration file

2. Check the logs, they should look the same as before. This is because the startup probe's command returns a 0 if it succeeds, and the kubelet considers the container to be alive and healthy. If it fails, then the container is killed and restarted. 

### Readiness Probe Config
1. Add a readiness probe to the deployment:
- initialDelaySeconds set to 1
- periodSeconds set to 2
- successThreshold set to 2
- failureThreshold set to 3
- Configure `httpGet` to have a path of `/` and a port of `80`

2. Check the logs now. Notice there are now GET requests from the probe every 2 seconds as specified by the default value for the "periodSeconds" field, indicating that nginx is ready to receive traffic.

### Liveness Probe Config

1. Add a liveness probe to the deployment: 
- initialDelaySeconds set to 10
- periodSeconds set to 5
- Configure `httpGet` to have a path of `/index.html`and a port of `80`
- Add a `hostPath` volume and `volumeMount`
- Use this simple html landing page for your index.html

### Deliverables
- Why might you use the same configuration for a startup probe and readiness probe?
- Determine whether liveness probes wait for readiness probes to succeed.
