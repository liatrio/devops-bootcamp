# Commit Reversals
Rebasing or "squashing" allows you to change the commit messages and rewrite git history. This should only be done if sensitive information is accidentally committed to git.

1. Create a new git repository on github. This can be public or private, and you can delete it afterwards.
  - go to github.com/<your_username> and click "new repository"
  - clone the repo locally
2. Add some files to the repository
  - to create files, you can simply echo some text and then pipe the output to a new file: `echo "this is an example" >> new file.txt`
  - add, commit, and push these contents up to github

Add some "sensitive content"
 - add a line with the text "SENSITIVE INFO" to one of your files
 - add, commit, and push your changes.
 - add some more changes, commit and push once again, so the bad password is not the last commit

Here we have created a problem. We have a commit that contains a password, or some other sensitive info, and if we delete it the info will still show up in the commit diff. We don't want to reset because we have commits after the password that we want to keep. There are a couple of approaches to fixing this:

## Option 1: git reset
Using a git reset, we can get rid of any commits after a specific point. As long as we don't use reset --hard the files themselves will not be changed, only the git history will be impacted. This is a good option if the trouble commit is near or at the current head of our git repository. To undo a commit with reset:

 - get the hash value of the commit just before the commit containing credentials
 - git log can be used to identify recent commits.
 - reset to that commit: `git reset 1a2b3c4` where 1a2b3c4 are the first 7 characters of the hash you just recorded
 - make the necessary changes to your file that gets rid of credentials using an editor, sed, etc.
 - commit the sanitized files
 - push the changes to remote using the -f flag
 This is a streamlined approach that is fairly easy, but at the cost of losing commit messages of anything staged after the offensive commit.

## Option 2: git rebase
Using a git rebase, we can remove only a single commit, which is useful for a commit that is not near the head, or for keeping important commit messages. To rebase:

 - get the hash value of the commit containing credentials
 - start an interactive rebase on that commit `git rebase -i 1a2b3c4^` where 1a2b3c4 are the first 7 characters of your hash
 - change 'pick' to 'edit' for the commit you want to change, and then exit the file
 - the rebase will stop when the 'edit' point is reached. Sanitize the commit by removing the credentials with an editor, sed command, etc.
 - add the changes if necessary: `git add <changed files>`
 - commit the changes using `git commit --amend -m "<new message here>"`
 - continue the rebase: `git rebase --continue`
 - push the changes to remote using the -f flag
This is a more involved approach, but allows all commits and history to be preserved.

These approaches both change git history, which will require a force push to propagate to the remote repository. Make sure you can force push, or ask an administrator to do it for you if necessary. Rewriting git history is a destructive process, and should only be carried out when necessary for security.

Another approach for deleting history of a specific file as opposed to a specific commit can be found here: https://help.github.com/articles/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository/

# Deliverable
Discuss why changing a git repository like this should be avoided and should be done to mitigate issues when it must be done.
