# Version Control

As the number of people working on a Git project increases, it becomes more difficult to keep merge conflicts under control and release code often.

There are a couple ways to combat this.
 - Keep teams small. A good sized team should be able to be fed by two pizzas. With microservices applications, teams might be divided according to different services. "Two-pizza teams" are ideal.
 - Adopt and enforce a good [branching strategy](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2428722/git-branch-strategy-for-small-dev-team).

In enterprise organizations, projects tend to be vast, so sometimes small teams don't make much sense. Therefore, implementing a great branching strategy is vital.

## Branching Strategies

A good branching strategy should solve the problems of merge conflicts and growing release cycles while also being simple to understand and adopt. A great way to measure the effectiveness of a branching strategy is to look at the commit history of a project that uses it.

## Stale Branches

One of the traps that many branching strategies fall into is that they try to maintain several long-living branches. As branches age, they become more and more difficult to merge; it's important to merge branches into a single eternal branch often. Ideally, a team should be merging into master at least once per day.

## Continuous Integration and Fast Feedback

This concept of short-lived branches syncs with how we approach continuous integration and fast feedback. When all the code is checked in to a single branch, everyone's code gets built together in CI and everyone is aware of integration bugs that would otherwise be hiding.

## Git Workflow

First, follow the [try.github.io](https://try.github.io) tutorial.

Then, check out the docs over at [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/docs). Level up your Git workflow.

You should be familiar with the following commands.
 - `git init`
 - `git clone`
 - `git add`
 - `git commit`
 - `git push`
 - `git branch`
 - `git checkout`

These also prove useful quite often.
 - `git status`
 - `git log`
 - `git diff`
 - `git blame`
 - `git bisect`
 - `git stash`
 - `git pull`
 - `git fetch`

## Security Considerations

Do NOT commit any private data to ANY repository. This due to the fact that we may need to add contributors or make a repository public at any time. Things such as private keys, secrets, passwords, etc. should all be stored securely and/or encrypted.

Git will keep record of your change, and you will need to rebase to rewrite the history and remove any sensitive information. It is important that we are secure, but we don't want to destroy git history unless its absolutely necessary.


## Rewriting History

Read [Merging vs. Rebasing](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing) by Atlassian.

Research the use cases and differences between the following.
 - `git commit --amend`
 - `git reset`
 - `git rebase`

# Deliverable

Locate an open-source project on GitHub and determine the branching strategy being used. Examine how difficult it would be to identify a bug introduced in that project's commit history. Discuss as a group.
