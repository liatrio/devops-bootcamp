# Version Control

As the number of people working on a Git project increases, it becomes more difficult to keep merge conflicts under control and release code often.

There are a couple ways to combat this.
 - Keep teams small. A good sized team should be able to be fed by two pizzas. With microservices applications, teams might be divided according to different services. "Two-pizza teams" are ideal.
 - Adopt and enforce a good [branching strategy](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2428722/git-branch-strategy-for-small-dev-team).

In enterprise organizations, projects tend to be vast, so sometimes small teams don't make much sense. Therefore, implementing a great branching strategy is vital.

## Branching Strategies

A good branching strategy should solve the problems of merge conflicts and growing release cycles while also being simple to understand and adopt. A great way to measure the effectiveness of a branching strategy is to look at the commit history of a project that uses it.

## Stale Branches

One of the traps that many branching strategies fall into is that they try to maintain several long-living branches. As branches age, they become more and more difficult to merge; it's important to merge branches into a single eternal branch often. Ideally, a team should be merging into master at least once per day.

## Continuous Integration and Fast Feedback

This concept of short-lived branches syncs with how we approach continuous integration and fast feedback. When all the code is checked in to a single branch, everyone's code gets built together in CI and everyone is aware of integration bugs that would otherwise be hiding.

## Git Workflow

Check out the docs over at [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/docs). Level up your Git workflow.

You should be familiar with the following commands.
 - `git init`
 - `git clone`
 - `git add`
 - `git commit`
 - `git push`
 - `git branch`
 - `git checkout`

These also prove useful quite often.
 - `git status`
 - `git log`
 - `git diff`
 - `git blame`
 - `git bisect`
 - `git stash`

## Rewriting History

Read [Merging vs. Rebasing](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing) by Atlassian.

Research the use cases and differences between the following.
 - `git commit --amend`
 - `git reset`
 - `git rebase`

# Deliverable

Locate an open-source project on GitHub and determine the branching strategy being used. Examine how difficult it would be to identify a bug introduced in that project's commit history. Discuss as a group.
