# Auto Scaling

This section demonstrates use cases for several AWS tools to provide performance scaling and high availability.

**Section Goals**
- Deploy and provision EC2 instances with User Data.
- Manually create a Load Balancer for EC2 instances.
- Create a Launch Configuration to automate creating EC2 instances.
- Create an Auto Scaling Group to manage availability of a service.

## About User Data

EC2 instances can be configured using the User Data option which runs commands when a new instance is launched. User Data can accomplish anything that shell commands can. You can think of it at being similar to the shell provisioner in Vagrant. User Data can be specified when launching an EC2 instances via the AWS Console or via the AWS CLI by utilizing the --user-data flag.

Read more about User Data in the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html#instancedata-add-user-data).

## Exercise 1 - Create EC2 instance with User Data

In this exercise we is create an EC2 instance and use a User Data script to provision the instance as host for a Java web application.

1. Using your notes from previous sections write a shell script which does the following:
  1. Install Tomcat and configures it to runs as a service.
  2. Install Maven.
  3. Download and build a Java Web application such as Spring Petclinic.
  4. Deploy your application to Tomcat and make is accessible at http://[PUBLIC_IP]/[APPLICATION_NAME].

2. Create a security group to expose Tomcat (port 8080).

3. Create an EC2 instance using your User Data shell script. Refer to the AWS CLI command you used in the previous section, add the `--user-data` flag and make sure to set the correct tags and the security group created above.

4. Once you have your User Data script working and instance setup create a second EC2 instance using the same User Data. Make sure to change the instance name and tags to differentiate it from the first.

**Tips**
- The EC2 instance will be slightly different from the virtual hosts or containers you have previously installed this software on so you will need to adapt the steps from your notes for this environment.
- Start off with a simple User Data script that only has a few steps, test those, fix any problems and then add more steps. Be patience and remember understanding how to trouble shoot installing software in different environments is an important skill.
- You can find output from your User Data script in `/var/log/messages`

### Deliverables
- Understand how User Data can be utilized to provision instances.
- Create a functional User Data script.
- Create two identical (except the tags) EC2 instances using the User Data script.
- Navigate to the application running within a browser.

## About Load Balancers

Load balancers distribute traffic from a single entry point across multiple servers. They can be used to increase performance as well as provide high availability of services.

## Exercise 2 - Setup Classic Load Balancer

In this exercise we will create a Classic Load Balancer in AWS which distributes traffic to the two instances created.

1. Open the Amazon [console](https://console.aws.amazon.com).
2. Select *EC2* from the *Services* menu and click *Load Balancers* in the left navigation bar.
3. Click *Create Load Balancer*.
4. Click *Create* under Classic Load Balancer.
5. Specify a name, such as <your-name>-dob-petclinic, add TCP port forwarding on port 8080 for Tomcat and click *Next: Assign Security Groups*.
6. Specify the same security group created in exercise 1. Click *Next: Configure Security Settings* and then *Next: Configure Health Check*.
7. Set *Ping Protocol* to TCP, *Ping Port* to 8080 and *Ping Path* to /petclinic (or the URL path to your application). These steps are important to ensure that the load balancer is properly setting the instances' healths. Hover over the question marks to get more information on the other settings. Click *Next: Add EC2 Instances*.
8. Select the instances created in exercise 1. Click *Next: Add Tags*.
9. Use Liatrio's recommended tag structure (outlined in 6.2) to create tags. Click *Review and Create*.
10. Review the settings and click *Create* to create the Classic Load Balancer.
11. Navigate to your Load Balancer in the list within the EC2 Console, and confirm that your instances are being load balanced and are healthy. If your Load Balancer is reflective of the image below, with the instances labeled as InService,
12. Navigate to the *DNS Name* of the load balancer (don't forgot to include the port and path of your application) and verify the application is being load balanced. Congratulations! You have now load balanced two automatically configured EC2 instances using User Data.

### Deeper Understanding

- In one of your instances try stopping Tomcat.
  - What is the health of the load balancer?
  - How long does it take for the health state to change?
  - Can you still access the application through the load balancer?
- Change some of the load balancer health check tuning settings and then restart your instance.
  - How long does it take for the health state to change?

### Deliverables
- Discuss as a group the benefits of load balancing traffic.
- Understand how to create a Classic Load Balancer with AWS.
- Understand how the load balancer uses health checks to manage traffic.
- Be able to view the application through the load balancer address.


## Exercise 3 - Launch Configurations

In this exercise we will create a Launch Configuration to automate creating EC2 instances.

1. Open the Amazon [console](https://console.aws.amazon.com).
2. Select *EC2* from the Services menu and click *Launch Configurations* under Auto Scaling.
3. Click *Create launch configuration*.
4. Select the Amazon Linux 2 AMI.
5. Select t2.micro and click *Next: Configure details*.
6. Name the Launch Configuration [YOUR_NAME]-dob-[APPLICATION_NAME].
7. Expand the *Advanced Details* panel, select the *As file* option under *User data*, click the *Browse* button and select your User Data script. Click *Next: Add Storage* and *Next: Configure Security Group*.

![The advanced details panel with user data as file selected](img6/advanced_details.webp ':class=img-shadow-center')

8. Choose the *Select an existing security group* option and select the security group you created in exercise 1. Click *Review* and *Create launch configuration*
9. Choose the SSH key pair you created earlier and click *Create launch configuration*.


### Deliverables
- Discuss the possible uses for launch configurations.

## 4. Auto Scaling Groups

![](img6/auto_scaling.svg ':size=70x70 :class=icon')

Below are instructions for setting up an Auto Scaling Group. Apply these instructions to your application. Keep in mind that these instructions were created for Tomcat 8 running Spring-Petclinic. Make necessary changes for your situation.

1. Navigate to the Amazon [console](https://console.aws.amazon.com).
2. Select *EC2* from the *Services* menu and click *Auto Scaling Groups* in the sidebar menu.
3. Click *Create Auto Scaling group*.
4. Chose the *Launch Configuration* and *Use an existing launch configuration* options and then select the Launch Configuration you created in the previous exercise. Click *Next Step*.
5. For the group name, name it [YOUR_NAME]-dob-[APPLICATION_NAME]. Specify to start with 2 instances. Select the Subnet associated with the load balancer created earlier.
6. Expand the *Advanced Details* panel, check *Receive Traffic from One or More Load Balancers* box and select the Load Balancer created earlier. Specify ELB for the Health Check type to use the health check configuration from the load balancer.  Click *Next:Configure scaling policies*.
7. Confirm *Keep this group at its initial size* to make sure the group always stays at 2. Click *Next: Configure Notifications* and *Next: Configure Tags*.
8. Create recommended tags outlined in section 6.2. Don't forget to create a Name tag with the pattern [YOUR_NAME]-dob-[APPLICATION_NAME]. Click *Review*.
9. Review the Auto Scaling Group settings and click *Create Auto Scaling group*.
10. View the instances list to confirm the auto scaling group is creating instances based on your Launch Configuration.
11. Check the load balancer and confirm it also includes the instances crated by the auto scaling group.

### Deeper Understanding

- Try stopping the Tomcat service in an instances created by the auto scaling group.
  - What happens to the health status?
  - What happens to the instance?
- Try terminating an instances created by the auto scaling group.

## Clean Up

Look up and execute the AWS CLI commands to remove the auto scaling group, launch configuration, load balancer, EC2 instances and security group created in this section. Check the AWS console to make sure all of the resources created in these exercises have been removed.
