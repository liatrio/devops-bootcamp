# Pull Requests

1. In your repository make a new branch and switch to it with
`git checkout -b my_new_branch`.
2. Make some changes to files on this branch.
3. Push your changes to the remote branch with `git push origin my_new_branch`.

Now you're ready to submit a pull request. A pull request, or PR, is a request
for others to pull in your work into their own repository. Pull requests aren't
a built in feature of git, rather they are a functionality of GitHub.

If you navigate to your repository on GitHub, and your pull request tab, you
can create a new pull request. Choose to compare your new branch with a base
of master. Once you submit the pull request you'll have the option to request
reviews from your peers and have an area for discussions about the branch.

Once the pull request is acceptable, it can be merged into master. In some
cases different options can be made to restrict merging, such as requiring
peer review, or unit testing.
