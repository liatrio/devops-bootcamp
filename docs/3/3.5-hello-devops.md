# Hello DevOps!

Now that you've obtained a basic understanding of core DevOps practices, let's put your knowledge to the test with a project of your own.

If you have been going through the bootcamp with others, now is the time to work on the project together.

The goal of this section is to build your own application and gain perspective of what developers in large enterprise experience.

## Requirements

This project can be anything you choose. However, there are some requirements.

### For Engineers:
 - It must be deployed to a production environment
 - Use project management software to track issues
 - Utilize a CI tool
 - Integrate the project management software with CI
 - Document the entire process, including the following
   - Branching strategy
   - How development and production environments were provisioned
   - How your application was built, tested, and ran

### For Consultants:
 - Read and execute the [Scrum Guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html) (schedule & facilitate all sprint meetings)
 - Understand and assign the role of Scrum Master and Product Owner
 - Determine a communication strategy
 - Ensure that the development team is using tickets to track progress using the board you created in the previous section 

## Previous Projects

This is meant to be a learning experience, but don't let that stop you from having a good time. Check out the following list of past projects for inspiration.

 - Twitter Clone, a clone of Twitter

# Deliverable

Once you have completed the application, you will be expected to not only demonstrate what you have done, but also what you learned while doing it. Do not simply talk about the end result, talk about the places you got stuck and how you got past those roadblocks. It can be very beneficial to include links to useful material that you used to learn about the subject matter. It is essential that you take time to prepare yourself before this presentation to ensure that you have a clear idea of what you want to say and what you want to demonstrate. As with any sort of public speaking, remaining relaxed and confident is very important, and remember to have fun with this. The audience is not judging you, they are just curious in what you've been working on.
