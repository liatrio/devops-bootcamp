# Pipelines and Strategy

Software delivery life cycles (SDLC) and pipelines both refer to the life cycle of planning, creating, testing, and deploying software.

In other words, a pipeline is the collection of processes involved for a line of a code to have an affect on the end user.

## Pair Programming

Pair programming keeps both programmers fully aware of what is happening in the code. It encourages communication and is a direct implementation of the idea that "two heads are better than one."

Pair programming happens by having two developers share one computer to get the work done. If someone is working remotely, they can screen-share, as well.

## Other Topics

In order to create an effective pipeline for any given project, you should first research some common practices.

 - Agile
   - Scrum
   - KanBan
   - Combination
 - Waterfall
 - Issue Tracking Integrations
 - Project Board Setups

# Deliverable

Discuss why teams would choose an agile development workflow or a waterfall method. Try out pair programming with someone to program an application that prints "Hello World" using a language of your choice.
