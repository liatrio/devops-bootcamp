# Hello DevOps

Now that you've obtained a basic understanding of core DevOps practices, let's put your knowledge to the test with a project of your own.

If you have been going through the bootcamp with others, everyone should work on one project.

## Requirements

This project can be anything you choose. However, there are some requirements.

 - It must be deployed to a production environment.
 - Use project management software to track issues.
 - Utilize a CI tool.
 - Integrate the project management software with CI.
 - Determine a communication strategy.
 - Document the entire process, including the following.
   - Branching strategy
   - How development and production environments were provisioned
   - How your application was built, tested, and ran

## Previous Projects

This is meant to be a learning experience, but don't let that stop you from having a good time. Check out the following list of past projects for inspiration.

 - Twitter Clone, a clone of Twitter
 - Network Monitor, a remote network monitoring tool
 - TeamQuery, a way for employees to give anonymous feedback

# Deliverable

Once you have completed the application, you will be expected to not only demonstrate what you have done, but also what you learned while doing it. Do not simply talk about the end result, talk about the places you got stuck and how you got past those roadblocks. It can be very beneficial to include links to useful material that you used to learn about the subject matter. It is essential that you take time to prepare yourself before this presentation to ensure that you have a clear idea of what you want to say and what you want to demonstrate. As with any sort of public speaking, remaining relaxed and confident is very important, and remember to have fun with this. The audience is not judging you, they are just curious in what you've been working on.
