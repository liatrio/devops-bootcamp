# Terraform Providers

At this point you should have a good grasp of how to declaratively define infrastructure as code and manage the state of that infrastructure using Terraform. Now we are going to pull back the curtain and take a deep dive into how Terraform works behind the scenes.

All resources and data sources in Terraform are created by a **provider**. Providers are Terraform plugins that define how resources are declared and how the state of those resources should be reconciled. Anyone can write a Terraform provider and providers can be shared publicly or privately via provider repositories. This extensibility is part of what makes Terraform so powerful.

?> Take a look at the providers that are published to the [official Terraform repository](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers)

In this section you will write your own Terraform provider to interact with an API we have written. The API defines some trivial endpoints which simulate operations to create, read, update and delete some resources. The API doesn't provide any real functionality but for the purposes of these exercises you should imagine that it provides an interface to configure a real service.

When you finish with this section you should have a much better understanding of how Terraform providers work which will help you learn and use other providers.

Throughout this section it will be helpful to refer to the [Custom Framework Providers](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/providers-plugin-framework) tutorial for example code, however there are significant differences between those tutorials and these exercises.

!> Be careful when googling for examples. There are many tutorials written for different versions of the Go Terraform plugin library that will not work with these exercises.

### Setup

Before starting on the exercise it is recommended to create a repo with the template from [terraform-provider-scaffolding](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-scaffolding-framework) repo.

> For this next step have one of your team members create this repository and include each other member as a collaborator/owner of the repository. This is just to have a repository that all your team members can collaborate on for the upcoming exercise parts in this section.

How to create template:

1. Go to the [terraform-provider-scaffolding](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-scaffolding-framework) repo.

2. Click on the button dropdown called `Use this template` and select `Create a new repository`

    ![terraform provider template button](img6/template_button.png ':size=912x162')

3. This should lead you to a new page where it asks you make a new repository templated from the `terraform-provider-scaffolding` repo.

    ![terraform provider template copy](img6/template_copy.png ':size=758x458')

?> For this part it is only required to place an owner and the repository name. It is recommended to setup the repository as public for other Liatrians to view and look at your work for context with questions. You can later delete or private this repository once you have completed the section of the bootcamp.

4. Once you are done setting up the repository you can press the `create repository from template` and this should start generating the repo from terraform-provider-scaffolding.

5. Now that you have your repo generated we now need to invite the rest of your team members to the repository.

    Have the owner of the repository go into the repository `Settings` tab and click on `Collaborators`

    ![terraform provider settings tab](img6/settings_tab.png ':size=906x80')

    Here you can see a button called `Add people`. Click on to get a pop-out to start sending invitations to your team-members to collaborate for the terraform provider.

    ![terraform provider collab tab](img6/collab_tab.png ':size=906x406')

### Exercise 1: Provider Boilerplate

This exercise will walk you through setting up the boilerplate for a Terraform provider and ensure you can test it locally.

1. Clone the repository made in the Setup section.

2. Change the provider name to `devops-bootcamp` and configure the provider server address as `liatr.io/terraform/devops-bootcamp` within the `main.go` of the repository.

3. Use the provided [Makefile](https://github.com/liatrio/devops-bootcamp/blob/4503cf73612b1e5be73e4f9d13717d0e157c4d0f/examples/ch6/provider-setup/Makefile) and the [Script](https://github.com/liatrio/devops-bootcamp/blob/7364553501872567fe105dc27f3cf84dd3a11cf8/examples/ch6/provider-setup/.make-helper.sh) that goes with it to initialize your repo. You will be asked later to analyze this Makefile and understand what it is doing in a deliverable. For now use it to get started.

?> The template repository comes provided with its own makefile `GNUmakefile`. Remove that makefile since the `Makefile` provided in Step 3 is an updated version of it.

4. Test that the provider executes correctly by running `go run main.go`. You should see the following output:

   ```bash
   This binary is a plugin. These are not meant to be executed directly.
   Please execute the program that consumes these plugins, which will
   load any plugins automatically
   exit status 1
   ```

5. With the makefile provided in Step 3 run `make init` this will build the binary and insert it into a directory named `.plugin-cache/`

6. Create a Terraform module with the following configuration to test your provider:

    ```go
    terraform {
      required_providers {
        devops-bootcamp = {
          source = "liatr.io/terraform/devops-bootcamp"
        }
      }
    }

    provider "devops-bootcamp" {
      # example configuration here
    }
    ```

7. Run `terraform init -plugin-dir=.plugin-cache` to source and use the built provider binary
   - From the Step 5 what is does `-plugin-dir` do in this step in context of terraform init?

8. Run `terraform plan` to ensure Terraform can find and use your provider.

### API Overview

This section of the boot camp will focus on using an ephemeral API
([API ReadMe](https://github.com/liatrio/devops-bootcamp/blob/7a7b695f669f13a6894bad2220cf34d5a8785d09/examples/ch6/devops-api/README.md))
  that the ferrets wave made. Take a moment to familiarize yourselves with the API.  It is important to know the overall structure of the API, and the components that you will need to create the custom terraform provider.
The API is using a web framework called [GIN](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) here is the link if you wanted to go more in-depth

The overall API is composed of 4 resources as shown below:

```bash
1. Engineer - an individual engineer
    - id (unique numeric or alphanumeric identifier)
    - name (string)
    - email (string: valid email address format)

2. Developer - a collection of developer engineers
    - id (unique numeric or alphanumeric identifier)
    - name (string)
    - engineers (list of engineer resources)

3. Operations - a collection of operations engineers
    - id (unique numeric or alphanumeric identifier)
    - name (string)
    - engineers (list of engineer resources)
    
4. DevOps - a combination of a collection of developer and operations engineers
    - id (unique numeric or alphanumeric identifier)
    - dev (dev resources)
    - ops (ops resource)
```

### Custom Provider Overview

Terraform providers work closely with the idea of CRUD operations. Meaning that the providers
try to classify API functionality into 4 groups, here are descriptions of the CRUD operations for the API:

- C[reate]
  - Creates new resource: dev, ops, devops, engineers
- R[ead]
  - Read in an existing resource
- U[pdate]
  - Update an existing resource, however we can not affect the sub-resources (engineers) inside it
- D[elete]
  - Deletes an existing resource, however we can not affect those resource's children

### Schema

The terraform provider framework manages data through its schema which acts as metadata and a "shape" for how the data its receiving should look. Since we are going to be interfacing with our API, the data should mirror the API data structure. [schema docs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/framework/schemas)

### Structs and types

In the provider you will have two sets of data structures to hold all your information:

1. The structs [Terraforms types](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/framework/types) will have many additional functionalities than standard Go types. These are needed in order to handle the data within your state and plans.

1. The structs with Go types are used to create the payloads you will be sending over to the api to process.

?> The Go type structs versions have been created for you in the API so you just need to import those to start using them. Use this documentation for the [struct module](https://github.com/liatrio/devops-bootcamp/blob/3cd9a063cc9834f055c4ebb82ecfeb750ff3ae1e/examples/ch6/devops-resources/README.md) to see how to import. You will have to implement the Terraform ones on your own and will need both in order to function correctly.

### Exercise 2: Implementing the provider

> We are going to be referencing the Hashicorp documentation throughout the next exercise.

For a lot of this section we are going to be leaning on a Hashicorp tutorial for the custom provider framework you will be using throughout all of this which can be found [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/providers-plugin-framework/providers-plugin-framework-provider).
The boilerplate you clone down in the beginning is going to mainly be to give you the general structure for how a provider should function but we will be filling up the contents with things from that tutorial.

?> Things to note: the setup earlier in this section does everything for the initial provider.go and main.go so we will start off on the [Configure](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/providers-plugin-framework/providers-plugin-framework-provider-configure) section.

#### Configuring the provider client

- A couple things to keep in mind here:
      1. The tutorial has a lot of extra checking and setting of variables you might not necessarily need
      2. Their struct that holds the data for the provider configuration includes things for authentication which the API we are using does not have
      3. Instead of having their client be an "http.DefaultClient" like in the boilerplate, they have a wrapper around that to keep all the other data they need for it close by and is probably something you should look into replicating.  A link to their implementation is [here](https://github.com/hashicorp-demoapp/hashicups-client-go)

### Challenge

- Ensure you write tests for Exercise 4 and 5 that go in depth to how the resource and data source should work before running terraform plan and apply.

!> Do not think about this last minute! Recommended to think about testing early. Helps with planning and designing how the provider will be built before beginning to build the rest of the resources and datasources.

### Exercise 3: Implementing Engineer resource and datasource

?> Some basic testing will be provided for engineers as a starting point for the challenge. It is encouraged to include more testing for your resources and datasources to ensure proper functionality for what was envisioned.

   1. Create a model for the engineers resource using the Terraform types.

   1. Think about what the Schema should look like:  
    - What does the data the API returns going to look like?
    - What variables does the API need vs what variables will be given to us?

   1. Implement all of the required CRUD operations using the tutorial as a reference.  
    - In the documentation they use methods within their client wrapper to perform the API calls:
        - This is time where you should plan how you want to organize these for the rest of your resources.
        - Recommendation: Making a wrapper as done in the tutorial is recommended to make the code easier to read and understand.

- Here is what some simple acceptance testing would look like for an Engineer resource, it also should be in a file with the same name as the one you
     are making the tests for followed by `_test`. Assuming you have your resources and tests in the right location, running `make testacc` which comes
     from the provided Makefile will run all your acceptance tests so you don't have to do them all individually:

```go
    package provider

    import (
     "testing"
     "github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/v2/helper/resource"
    )

    func TestEngineerResource(t *testing.T) {
     resource.Test(t, resource.TestCase{
      ProtoV6ProviderFactories: testAccProtoV6ProviderFactories,
      Steps: []resource.TestStep{
       // Create and Read testing
       {
                    provider "devops-bootcamp" {
                        endpoint = "http://localhost:8080"
                    } 
                
                    resource "devops-bootcamp_engineer" "test" {
                        name  = "Bobby"
                        email = "Bobby@gmail.com"
                    }
      ,
    Check: resource.ComposeAggregateTestCheckFunc(
     // Verify name
     resource.TestCheckResourceAttr("devops-bootcamp_engineer.test", "name", "Bobby"),
     // Verify email
     resource.TestCheckResourceAttr("devops-bootcamp_engineer.test", "email", "Bobby@gmail.com"),
     // Verify dynamic values have any value set in the state.
     resource.TestCheckResourceAttrSet("devops-bootcamp_engineer.test", "id")),
   },
   // Update and Read testing
   {
  
                provider "devops-bootcamp" {
                    endpoint = "http://localhost:8080"
                } 
                
                resource "devops-bootcamp_engineer" "test" {
                    name  = "updatedBobby"
                    email = "updatedBobby@gmail.com"
                }
  ,
    Check: resource.ComposeAggregateTestCheckFunc(
     // Verify name/email updated
     resource.TestCheckResourceAttr("devops-bootcamp_engineer.test", "name", "updatedBobby"),
     resource.TestCheckResourceAttr("devops-bootcamp_engineer.test", "email", "updatedBobby@gmail.com"),
    ),
   },
   // Delete testing automatically occurs in TestCase
  },
 })
}
```

?> For this section ignore how the datasource is implemented in the tutorial as it is an incredibly uncommon approach, your datasource should be 1:1 to another resource of the same type.  Datasources are used to get information about resources not managed by terraform, and given that they aren't being managed, you will lack certain information about them such as an ID so you will need to look at the API for another way to grab the desired resources.

?> Also think about what should happen when Terraform goes to fetch information about a resource it has inside its state but cant find in the API.  What does that mean and how should it be corrected?

### Exercise 4: Implementing Dev, Ops, DevOps resource and datasource

Implementing the next resources are going to be similar to the implementation of the engineer resource. Refer back to the section [API Overview](#api-overview)

1. You will need to implement all the same functionality as the Engineer resource, the only difference here is that you will need to use additional terraform data structures in order to be able to handle some of the data or lack thereof that is returned from the API.
    - These data structures also include handy conversion methods that allow you to go from terraform types to Go types (although you can do some of this
      manually as well) on top of other functions like `tfsdk.ValueFrom()` which let you go the other direction. The only caveat for these functions is
      that you will need to do a little research on Go interfaces since those are what these methods use to convert the data.

?> This is another point where you really need to look into how you plan to design these resources in terraform and what exactly a user would want or expect to see from them.  Just because something looks a certain way inside the API doesn't mean that you should mirror that inside of terraform, adding too much complexity to your schemas is a recipe for future headaches. Its highly recommended to run your ideas by someone more experienced before executing them to make sure you don't potentially have to come back later to redesign it.
