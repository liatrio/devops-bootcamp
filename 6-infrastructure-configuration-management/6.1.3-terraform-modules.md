# Terraform Modules

The previous sections should have illustrated how flexible and powerful Terraform is. As organizations adopt Terraform for more of their infrastructure and size of their Terraform configurations grow they also need better ways to organize and maintain those configurations. Terraform configurations can be organized into modules to make the code more reusable and easier to maintain. In fact any Terraform code in a folder is a module so you have already written Terraform modules and not known it! Of course what makes Terraform modules useful is the ability to use them together and share them with others.
