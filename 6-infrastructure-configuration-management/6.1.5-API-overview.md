([API ReadMe](https://github.com/liatrio/devops-bootcamp/blob/a331c9598fdd5187eb324a9b54578e45b7a5dfb9/examples/ch6/devops-api/readMe.md))
  that the ferrets wave made. Take a moment to familiarize yourselves with the API.  It is important to know the overall structure of the API, and the components that you will need to create the custom terraform provider.
The API is using a web framework called [GIN](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) here is the link if you wanted to go more in-depth
