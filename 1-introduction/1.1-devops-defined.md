Let's see what the experts have to say. Be sure to follow the links to get more context from the sources.

> DevOps (a portmanteau of software development and server operations) represents the integration between software development and operations engineering that has become increasingly necessary with the emergence of cloud computing. In essence, the jobs are no longer mutually exclusive- developers need more operations-based knowledge in order to understand how their application will be deployed, test locally and preemptively address potential security risks, while systems administrators need to know developer-based materials in order to design infrastructure optimally to fit an application’s needs without wasting capacity and to troubleshoot issues with the increasingly complex software cycle. Additionally, site reliability engineering and many modern security roles require a background with a balance between development and operations.

# Concepts
Now that we have some idea what DevOps means let's look at some important concepts. This list is not comprehensive but should help you get started.

## Effectiveness over Efficiency
In order to build and operate the kinds of complex, distributed systems required for modern software development, we need to [emphasize effectiveness over efficiency](http://labs.openviewpartners.com/results-driven-leadership-decision-making/) for technical teams. Delivering changes rapidly, reliably, and repeatedly is not possible if we aim to minimize ‘costs’ at specific points of the value chain, as this kind of efficiency usually ends up causing unnecessary constraints. Instead, we should focus on the flow and completion of work in progress. Change Request tickets should not sit in a queue for days, we should not separate ‘testing’ as something that happens only ‘after development’, and changes should not sit waiting weeks and weeks for the Staging or Pre-Production environment to be available.


## The Three Ways

 1. **Systems Thinking**: Learn how everything is interconnected, from concept to customer.

 2. **Amplifying Feedback Loops**: Cut the time between action and reaction, failure and success.

 3. **Culture of Continuous Experimentation and Learning**: Recognize that failure is important data about how and where to improve.

## CAMS

 1. **Culture**: It’s about how people relate and work, which is not something you can buy.

 2. **Automation**: Faster, less error-prone processes help amplify feedback loops.

 3. **Measurement**: You can’t get where you want to be until you know where you are.

 4. **Sharing**: Effective teamwork ignores organizational boundaries.

## ICE

 1. **Inclusivity**: Everyone is responsible for (and benefits from) these practices.

 2. **Complex Systems**: Iteration is imperative to maintain a grasp on complexity.

 3. **Empathy**: Real collaboration requires an understanding of another person’s point of view.

## Culture

We will spend a lot of time talking about tools and technology but it cannot be stressed enough the importance of a **culture** that supports **inclusion** and **empathy**.

Watch this [KubeCon 2019 keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiaLsxjBeOQ) in which Kelsey Hightower reflects on his experiences in the Kubernetes community.

## Tools

As DevOps evolves and grows, various tools have been developed to aid the collaborative and development processes.
Having a strong toolset along with the knowledge of tools can be the difference between a mediocre engineer and a great one. 

Look through [The DevOps Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/devops) to get an idea of a modern toolset used by DevOps engineers, many of which will be touched on throughout the bootcamp.
