# Networking

While computer networking isn't the focus of DevOps work, it is highly relevant
as supplementary knowledge. Virtualization, containerization, and cloud
services are all common tools in a DevOps toolkit, and all require at least a
basic understanding of networking topics.

This chapter covers these networking basics, providing the foundational
knowledge that will be useful within this Bootcamp, and the DevOps industry
as a whole.

## IP Addresses

- IP Addresses are a series of numbers which represent a single device
on a network, similar to a home address referring to a specific building in a
city.
- There are two versions of IP Address, IPv4 and IPv6.
  - IPv4 addresses are represented by four numbers (0 - 255) separated by
periods, such as `172.217.0.46`.
  - IPv6 addresses are represented as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits
separated by colons, such as `2001:0db8:0000:0042:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`.
  - IPv6 can represent far more unique addresses, but is still in the
process of adoption, and it's generally more common to see IPv4 addresses.
- Each device on a network is given a unique IP address, sometimes manually,
but more often automatically, such as by a dynamic host configuration protocol
(DHCP) server.
- A single device can have more that one IP address that refers to it, but no
two machines on the same network should ever share an IP.

## Hostnames

- A hostname is an alternative way to specify an IP Address.
- Hostnames look like regular web addresses like `google.com`, and are turned
into IP addresses in a process called DNS resolution.
- An IP address can have multiple hostnames that resolve to it, but each
hostname should only ever have a single IP it resolves to.
- One important hostname is `localhost`, which refers to the computer itself.
The computer where a shell or process is running can be referred to by its own IP, `localhost`, or the
loopback IP `127.0.0.1`, which always refers to itself.

## Ports

- Ports are numbers representing different connections that a device can
have at the same time, similar to letters addressed to different people
at the same physical address.
- Often, a port is denoted following a hostname and
separated by a colon, such as `localhost:8080`.
- Servers generally expect communication on specific ports, and they won't
respond to communication on the wrong port, even if the IP is correct.

Some services and network traffic tend to run on known ports. A few of these
ports are:
- SSH, port 22
- HTTP, port 80
- HTTPS, port 443

## Subnets

Ranges of IP addresses are often divided into networks. When
we have several devices on the same network, some portion of the address
defines the network address, while the remainder defines the device, or host,
address.

When describing networks a common method is to use CIDR notation. CIDR notation
uses an IP address followed by a slash and another number from 1 to 32.
For example `192.168.0.36/24`.
The second number denotes the number of bits that make up the network address,
when the IP is interpreted as binary. The remainder of the bits are the host
portion of the address.

| CIDR Notation   | Mask          | Network Address |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 10.1.145.4/16   | 255.255.0.0   | 10.1.0.0        |
| 192.168.5.40/24 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.5.0     |
| 10.0.162.5/20   | 255.255.240.0 | 10.0.160.0      |

## Private IP Ranges

Finally, there are a few IP ranges that are reserved as private addresses.
This means that no public server will ever be granted one of these IPs.
When setting up private or internal networking, using IP addresses
within a private range will ensure no conflicts with public servers.

| CIDR Block     | Address Range                 | Number of Addresses |
|----------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| 10.0.0.0/8     | 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255     | 16,777,216          |
| 172.16.0.0/12  | 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255   | 1,048,576           |
| 192.168.0.0/16 | 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 | 65,536              |

# Exercise

Examine the network your computer is on and try to answer the following questions:
- What subnet is your computer on?
- How many IP address are available on the subnet?
- What is your computers IP address on the subnet?
- How did your computer get assigned that IP address?
- What is your computers public Internet IP address? (hint: google `what is my ip`)
- How does the private subnet IP address of your computer and the public Internet IP address relate to each other? How does traffic get routed from the Internet to your computer?

# Deliverable

Discuss the role networking plays in software delivery and difficulties enterprise organization may experience with networking.
