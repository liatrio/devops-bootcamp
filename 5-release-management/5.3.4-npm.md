# Npm

Npm is similar to Maven in that it provides a central document that determines the various SDLC phases (pom or package.json). Both provide ways to explicitly manage dependencies and their versions using SemVer. The primary differences lie in the two languages that they support, as Javascript doesn't need to be compiled the same way that Java does.

Read [About npm](https://www.npmjs.com/about), [What is npm?](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm), and [Working with package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/using-a-package.json).

Watch [this introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x03fjb2VlGY).

Go over the rest of the [npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com).

## Commands

Research the following commands as well as the `-g` option.
 - `npm install`
 - `npm start`
 - `npm test`

## SemVer

Watch [Semantic versioning and npm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK4Meix58R4) on YouTube.

## Practice
Ensure you have npm, NodeJS, and Java installed your computer. Download Java [here](https://java.com/en/download/) if necessary. (or use Homebrew!)

Check your current version of Node with `node -v`.

If you need to install Node, it's recommended to use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm/blob/master/README.md).

Install Gulp globally with `sudo npm install -g gulp`.

Clone [Dromedary](https://github.com/liatrio/dromedary.git).
```
git clone https://github.com/liatrio/dromedary.git
cd dromedary
npm install
```

Start the App with `npm start`.

Figure out what command should be used to test the App and run the tests.
