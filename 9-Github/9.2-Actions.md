# Github Actions

 In this section we will be working with Github Actions in order to introduce some basic automation to our repository as well as create some of that automation ourselves with our own custom action as well as reusable workflows

## Exercise 1

 The first thing we are going to do is create a new repository to work with and inside that repo add a folder `.github/workflows/` to it. Inside this folder is where we will be storing the workflows we create. If you were to go into the `Actions` tab, you also have the option of adding common workflows directly to your repo which will also create this directory structure for you.

Inside our newly created directory, we are going to create another file called `getting-started.yml` and put this basic workflow inside of it:
```
# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "simple"
  simple:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo password
```
> Before this next part, a look at the [Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions) for Github Actions to learn about exactly what each of these steps do.

To complete this exercise we are going to make some changes to this file as well as work with the settings of the repo. There are a few things specifically to do:
  1. Add a trigger to manually run the workflow
  2. Take our `password` here and put it into a secret for us to use in our workflow
