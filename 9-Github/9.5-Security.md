# Github Security

## Code scanning

Code scanning is a GitHub feature that allows you to automatically scan your code for security vulnerabilities. Code scanning works by integrating with third-party static analysis tools, which analyze your code for potential security issues such as buffer overflows, cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, and SQL injection vulnerabilities. Code scanning can be set up to run automatically as part of your continuous integration (CI) pipeline, which helps catch vulnerabilities early in the development process. Code scanning can also be used to enforce security policies across all of your repositories.

## Secret scanning

Secret scanning is a GitHub feature that helps prevent secrets such as API keys and access tokens from being accidentally committed to your repository. Secret scanning works by scanning your repositories for potential secrets using regular expressions, and notifying you if any are found. If a potential secret is found, you will receive an email notification with details on how to remove the secret from your repository.

## Dependabot alerts

Dependabot alerts are notifications that GitHub sends when vulnerabilities are discovered in software dependencies used by your repositories. Dependabot alerts work by scanning your repositories for known vulnerabilities in dependencies, and sending you an email notification if any are found. Dependabot alerts can be set up to automatically create pull requests that update your dependencies to the latest secure version.

## Dependabot security updates

Dependabot security updates are automatic pull requests that update your dependencies to the latest secure version when vulnerabilities are discovered. Dependabot security updates work by scanning your repositories for known vulnerabilities in dependencies, and automatically creating a pull request that updates the dependency to the latest secure version. Dependabot security updates can be set up to automatically merge the pull request if all tests pass, which helps ensure that your code is always up-to-date and secure.
