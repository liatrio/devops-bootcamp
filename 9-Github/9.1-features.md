# Highlighting Githubs Features/Services

## Issues
   Github Issues is a ticketing feature designed to help you and others keep track of general to-do's on your repo (Future features, bug-fixes, etc).  Within these 
   you are able to include things like:
   - Labels to quickly see what the issue is related with a small tag and a corresponding color
   - The person assigned to the ticket if any as well as who created the ticket
   - Milestones in order to keep track of progress on that specific issue
   - Linked project which is another feature of github 

## Actions
   Github Actions is Github's system for pipelines and automation.  It allows you to do things like:
   - Create workflow files in your repo to perform specific actions on a trigger like build your app, run tests, and integrate with other Github features
   - Build custom actions to promote code-reuse which you can make private or public so others in the community can use them
