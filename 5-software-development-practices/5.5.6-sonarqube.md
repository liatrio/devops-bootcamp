# SonarQube

[SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/) is an open source source code analysis platform. It can be integrated with a variety of continuous integration tools to automate code quality tests. With minimal configuration it includes a suite of test to detect bugs, code smells and security vulnerabilities.

## Goals

This section will give you experience with:

- Installing a SonarQube server
- Installing a SonarQube scanner
- Configuring Jenkins to run the SonarQube scanner as part of a job

### Create new SonarQube service

Here we will setup a new SonarQube server which will listen for requests from our Jenkins pipeline to scan our code.

1. Create a new virtual host and expose port 9000.
2. Install SonarQube [Installation Instructions](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/setup/install-server/).
3. Log into SonarQube [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000). The default username and password is `admin` and `admin`.
4. Go to to Administration -> Security -> Users and click on the Update Tokens button.

5. Generate a new token and make sure to save it.

### Configure the Jenkins job to run SonarQube scanner

Now we need to configure Jenkins to send the request to scan our code to our SonarQube server. The exact process for this depends on tools being used. Take a look at the [Analyzing Source Code](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/overview/) section of the SonarQube docs for more information.

1. Install the SonarScanner for Jenkins.
2. Go to Jenkins Global Tool Configuration and enter the path to where you installed the scanner.

3. Go to Jenkins Configure System and configure your SonarQube server.

4. Modify the Go Unit Testing Freestyle Project to have the SonarQube scanner configured as the first build step.

5. You may need to change the Analysis properties to match the structure of the project. Note: you can also set the properties in a sonar-project.properties file in the root of the project.
6. Build your project and look at the results in SonarQube.
