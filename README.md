  # Liatrio's DevOps Bootcamp

</center>

Welcome! You must be here because you're interested in DevOps. Don't worry, we'll explain that right away! Let's introduce some goals and expectations first, though.

## Learning Goals
 1. DevOps Philosophies and Culture
 2. DevOps in Enterprises
 3. Build and Deployment Engineering
 4. Tools Administration
 5. Build and Deployment Automation
 6. Release Notes Creation and Execution

## Expectations
 1. Share what you learn. Knowledge is best retained when you can teach it back yourself.
 2. If you're participating in the bootcamp with others, lift them up instead of speeding past them.
 3. Your learning should be in a demonstrable state at any given time.
 4. The turtle wins the race. If you don't fully understand something, speak up for help and spend more time on it.
 5. Be transparent in your progress.
 6. Have fun!
