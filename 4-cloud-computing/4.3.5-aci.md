# Azure Container Instances (ACI)

While building VMs and VM scale sets are appropriate in some cases, this would probably be a wasteful approach to deploy a small Node.js application. Instead of deploying an entire server to host our application, we will package our small application in a Docker image and launch an instance in ACI.

> [Azure Container Instances](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-instances/) provides a fast and simple way to run containers in Azure, without having to manage any virtual machines and without having to adopt a higher-level service. When more complicated scenarios are required, such as service discovery across multiple containers, automatic scaling, and coordinated application upgrades, it is best to use Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) instead of ACI. We will cover AKS in the next section. It is actually possible to use ACI as burst capacity for AKS, so the solutions are not mutually exclusive.

> [Azure Container Registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/) is used to build, store, secure, scan, and replicate container images and artifacts. It is often used in combination with ACI and AKS.

## Create a Docker image and launch an instance in ACI

1. We will use the same Node.js app as the previous sections.

```bash
mkdir /Users/YOUR_NAME/aci-bootcamp
mv /Users/YOUR_NAME/webapp /Users/YOUR_NAME/aci-bootcamp/
```

2. Create Dockerfile.

```bash
mkdir /Users/YOUR_NAME/aci-bootcamp
cat <<EOF > /Users/YOUR_NAME/aci-bootcamp/Dockerfile
FROM node:8.9.3-alpine
RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app
COPY webapp/ /usr/src/app/
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
RUN npm install
CMD node /usr/src/app/index.js
EXPOSE 3000
EOF
```

3. Build the Docker image locally.

4. Run the container locally to make sure it works.

?> You will need to map the port the container is listening on (TCP 3000) to a port on your local machine in order to test.

5. Log into Azure CLI and select the correct subscription.

6. Create a resource group for ACR and ACI resources.

7. Create an ACR instance to host our Docker images.

```bash
REGISTRY_NAME=YOUR_NAMEbootcamp
az acr create \
  --name $REGISTRY_NAME \
  --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
  --sku Standard
```

?> Registry names must be globally unique.

8. Log into the ACR instance.

```bash
az acr login --name $REGISTRY_NAME
```

9. Get the server address of your ACR instance.

```bash
DOCKER_SERVER=$(az acr show \
  --name $REGISTRY_NAME \
  --query loginServer \
  --output tsv)
```

10. Tag the image and push to ACR.

```bash
docker tag aci-bootcamp $DOCKER_SERVER/aci-bootcamp:v1
```

```bash
docker push $DOCKER_SERVER/aci-bootcamp:v1
```

11. Use Azure CLI to List images in your ACR instance and make sure your Docker push was successful.

12. Create a service principles to use with ACR. [Click here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals) to learn more about service principal objects in Azure AD.

```bash
SP_NAME="http://YOUR_NAME-devops-bootcamp-acr"
REGISTRY_ID=$(az acr show --name $REGISTRY_NAME --query id --output tsv)
DOCKER_PASSWORD=$(az ad sp create-for-rbac --name $SP_NAME --scopes $REGISTRY_ID --role acrpull --query password --output tsv)
DOCKER_USERNAME=$(az ad sp list --display-name $SP_NAME --query '[0].appId' --output tsv)
```

?> You need owner role or equivalent permissions on a subscription to create service principals. If you don't have access, you may want to do this short lab in your free Microsoft account.

13. Launch an instance in ACR.

```bash
az container create \
  --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
  --name aci-bootcamp \
  --image $DOCKER_SERVER/aci-bootcamp:v1 \
  --cpu 1 \
  --memory 1 \
  --registry-login-server $DOCKER_SERVER \
  --registry-username $DOCKER_USERNAME \
  --registry-password $DOCKER_PASSWORD \
  --dns-name-label devopsbootcamp \
  --ports 3000
```

14. Use Azure CLI to check the deployment status, access container logs, and test access to the site.

15. Clean up resources and delete the service principal.
